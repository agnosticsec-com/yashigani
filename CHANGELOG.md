## [Unreleased] — v2.24.1

### Added
- **Per-user rate limit — 100 RPS / 200 burst** (YSG-RISK-058, Tiago 2026-05-24):
  new `user` dimension added to `RateLimiter.check()`. When an authenticated user
  (identified via `x-yashigani-user-id` header set by Caddy `forward_auth`) exceeds
  100 requests/second (burst 200), the gateway returns HTTP 429 + `Retry-After`
  header. Configurable via `YASHIGANI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_USER_RPS` env var; burst is
  automatically 2× the configured RPS.

  On breach, two admin alert signals fire simultaneously:
  1. **Prometheus metric** `yashigani_user_rate_limit_violations_total{user_id_hash="<sha256[:16]>"}`
     — in-stack monitoring. Grafana alert rule at
     `config/grafana/alerts/user-rate-limit-burst.json` fires when a user accumulates
     more than 5 breaches in a 5-minute window (2-minute `for:` period).
  2. **Audit event** `USER_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` — emitted to the audit chain with
     the full (admin-only) user identifier. Wazuh customers can route this event type
     to email/Slack/webhook via their configured ruleset.

  `user_id` is hashed (SHA-256, 16-char hex prefix) in ALL metric labels and
  external-facing surfaces. Full identifier only in the admin-only audit chain.

  Distinct from DDoSProtector per-IP layer (YSG-RISK-056) — these are two
  complementary mechanisms: DDoS = coarse flood protection at IP layer;
  per-user = per-authenticated-identity throttle + operator observability.

  Redis key: `yashigani:rl:user:<hashed_user_id>` (DB 2, same namespace as other RL buckets).

### Fixed
- **DDoSProtector wire-up** (CHANGELOG drift audit finding #2): `DDoSProtector` was
  instantiated in `entrypoint.py` and wired into both `configure_openai_router()` and
  `create_gateway_app()`. Previously the class existed but was never instantiated, making
  the v2.20 CHANGELOG entry ("per-IP `DDoSProtector` Redis-backed, 429 + `Retry-After`")
  dead code. That claim is now true.

### Changed
- **License-scaled DDoS defaults** (YSG-RISK-056, Tiago 2026-05-24): per-IP
  connection limit now scales with `LicenseState.max_end_users` so large deployments
  are not blocked by a fixed ceiling. Formula: `max(5000, max_end_users * 25)`.
  The 25× multiplier assumes a worst-case corporate-NAT topology where many licensed
  users share a single egress IP. Enterprise/academic (unlimited, `max_end_users == -1`)
  → 100 000. Resulting per-tier defaults:
  | Tier | max_end_users | per-IP limit |
  |---|---|---|
  | community / canary | 5 | 5 000 (floor) |
  | igniter | 50 | 5 000 (floor) |
  | starter | 100 | 5 000 (floor) |
  | professional | 500 | 12 500 |
  | professional_plus | 4 000 | 100 000 |
  | enterprise / academic | -1 | 100 000 (sentinel) |

  `YASHIGANI_DDOS_PER_IP_LIMIT` env var still overrides the computed default.
  Startup log now emits:
  `"DDoSProtector configured: max_end_users=N → per_ip_limit=M (source=license|env), window=60s"`
- **Permissive DDoS floor** (from previous entry): floor of 5000 still applies.
  Caddy timeouts remain the first-line flood defence; this second-line gate fires
  only on extreme volume. Override env vars:
  - `YASHIGANI_DDOS_PER_IP_LIMIT` — integer, requests per window per IP (wins over license-computed)
  - `YASHIGANI_DDOS_WINDOW_SECONDS` — integer, window length in seconds
  - `YASHIGANI_DDOS_EXEMPT_PATHS` — comma-separated extra paths to exempt
- **Redis DB 5** dedicated to DDoS counters (DB 2 = rate-limit/anomaly,
  DB 3 = RBAC/agents/identity, DB 4 = response-cache; DB 5 was free).
- `/_yashigani/healthz` added to `_EXEMPT_PATHS` (was missing from class defaults).

## [v2.23.4] — 2026-05-21

> The v2.23.4 release closes the v2.23.3 follow-up backlog, ships the SAML BYOK
> config-load surface, multi-platform install robustness improvements, a
> new CI gate that prevents Caddyfile / service-identity drift between compose
> and Helm, an architectural close of the cleanup-system class (state file +
> container-fallback rm + cross-UID handlers across install/uninstall), the
> pgbouncer mTLS sidecar (`letta-pgbouncer`) closing YSG-RISK-048, and the
> KMS-architectural reframe for credential handling (non-KMS dev posture vs
> KMS-configured production posture documented at
> `docs/yashigani_install_config.md` §6.1).

### Added

- **Open WebUI → gateway in-mesh path** — gateway now exposes a dual-port
  surface: `:8080` for mTLS edge traffic and `:8081` for plain-HTTP in-mesh
  traffic from Open WebUI carrying an `Authorization: Bearer
  yashigani-internal` token. Open WebUI joins the `caddy_internal` network
  and routes chat completions via the gateway rather than direct to Ollama,
  so OPA policy + identity-binding apply to UI traffic just like to API
  traffic. Closes the "Open WebUI bypasses the gateway" architectural gap.
- **Installer use-case wizard** — interactive `install.sh` now asks whether
  Yashigani will be used by humans with a web UI (default `Y`, installs Open
  WebUI as the chat surface) or as an API/agent-only deployment (`N`,
  skips Open WebUI). Non-interactive `--with-openwebui` flag unchanged.
- **Ollama default-model auto-pull on `--with-openwebui`** — first install
  with Open WebUI now pulls `qwen2.5:3b` automatically so the chat UI works
  out of the box. Helm chart equivalent: `ollama-init` Job pulls the same
  model when `openWebui.enabled=true`. Skip with `--no-default-model`.
- **SAML BYOK config-load surface** — `broker.add_idp()` now accepts SAML
  identity-provider configurations via the `YASHIGANI_IDP_<N>_SAML_*`
  environment variables (idp metadata URL/XML, SP entity ID, ACS URL, SP
  private key, SP certificate). `_assert_rsa_sp_key()` runs at config-load
  time, rejecting non-RSA SP keys at container startup rather than at first
  signature attempt. Mitigates the libgcrypt ECDH heap-overflow class
  (CVE-2026-41989) at config-load.
- **HUMAN identity registration on local-auth login** — local password+TOTP
  users now get an identity-registry entry created automatically on first
  login, with tier-aware metadata. Closes the design gap where local-auth
  users had no identity-registry presence.
- **`/me/api-key` self-service Bearer issuance** — users can mint, list, and
  revoke their own API keys from the user UI. Step-up TOTP required for
  issuance (ASVS V6.8.4). API-key strings are hash-stored; `last4` shown in
  UI for identification.
- **Container auto-start on host reboot** — compose installs now provision a
  user-scoped `systemd --user` unit under `loginctl enable-linger` so the
  gateway and backoffice come back up after a host reboot without operator
  intervention. Helm path already handled by Kubernetes.
- **`--http-port` / `--https-port` CLI flags** — `install.sh` exposes port
  remapping for hosts where 80/443 are taken. Defaults unchanged.
- **Langflow + Letta in `agentBundles`** — Helm chart wires Langflow and Letta
  as opt-in agent-bundle services with per-bundle tokens, `securityContext`,
  and matching K8s Secrets. Disabled by default.
- **Email-as-username + suspended-identity reactivation flow** — local-auth
  accounts identify by email rather than free-form username; admin
  reactivation action covers the suspended-identity case.
- **Auth-gated OpenAPI / Swagger UI** — the Backoffice now exposes
  `GET /admin/openapi.json`, `GET /admin/api-docs` (Swagger UI), and
  `GET /admin/api-redoc` behind `require_admin_session`. The Gateway exposes
  `GET /openapi.json` and `GET /docs` behind identity resolution (same
  Bearer/SSO check as `/v1/*`). Anonymous access returns 401. Swagger UI
  assets are self-hosted from `static/swagger-ui/` (swagger-ui-dist 5.32.6)
  to satisfy `script-src 'self'` CSP.

### Fixed

- **Gateway pgbouncer-DSN advisory-lock deadlock** — `run_migrations()` in the
  gateway service used the pgbouncer DSN for the migration advisory lock.
  Under pgbouncer session-recycling the lock survived `lock_conn.close()`,
  leaving it held on a recycled backend pid; the backoffice's lifespan
  acquisition then deadlocked. Surfaced on Mac Podman (Linux VM was
  timing-lucky). Fix: gateway service now has `YASHIGANI_DB_DSN_DIRECT`
  pointing at postgres directly, matching the long-standing backoffice
  pattern.
- **Install — contaminated-volume detection** — `install.sh` now refuses to
  proceed when a leftover `docker_postgres_data` volume holds an old PKI CA
  bundle, because postgres DB-init scripts run only on an empty volume.
  Operator is directed to `uninstall.sh --remove-volumes` or
  `install.sh --upgrade`.
- **Uninstall — partial `.env` handling** — `uninstall.sh` now stubs missing
  required `:?` environment variables before `compose down`, covering the
  operator path where a prior install failed partway and left an incomplete
  `docker/.env`. Previously gated only on `.env` being entirely absent.
- **Uninstall — dependency-graph leak on `--remove-volumes`** — compose-down
  now force-removes containers in leaf-first dependency order before volume
  removal, then runs a final cleanup pass to catch redis straggler containers
  that respawn during Podman network teardown.
- **Uninstall — multi-user PKI cleanup** — `docker/secrets/` is now wiped on
  `--remove-volumes` so a subsequent install by a different Unix user does
  not fail on PKI key ownership.
- **macOS Podman — virtiofs `:U` ownership remap** — all bind-mounts of
  secret material apply `:U` (and ephemeral chown where needed) on macOS
  Podman. Linux Podman unaffected. Scoped to macOS Podman after a regression
  on rootful Linux.
- **Helm — OPA mTLS wired correctly on K8s install**, and OPA probes use the
  HTTPS scheme when `mtls.enabled=true`.
- **Helm — `tls_trusted_ca_certs` → `tls_trust_pool`** chart-side Caddyfile
  migration to caddy 2.11's replacement directive.
- **Helm — `admissionPolicies.enabled` default is now `false`** because the
  chart's Kyverno ClusterPolicy resources require Kyverno to be installed
  in the cluster. Default-on caused stock `helm install` to fail on clusters
  without Kyverno. Opt in with `--set admissionPolicies.enabled=true`; the
  chart now fails fast with a friendly error if Kyverno CRDs are missing.
- **SPA — inline styles removed; CSP tightened** with no `unsafe-inline` for
  `style-src`.
- **Auto-agent-registration — 401 on Layer B header path fixed** during
  installer-driven agent bundle registration.
- **Helm — K8s OPA policy bundle aligned with compose** — the helm chart
  previously shipped a stub OPA ConfigMap with package `yashigani.v1_routing`
  and no `decision` / `allow_v1` rules. Gateway read `result.get("allow",
  False)` against that empty result → 403 on every K8s chat request.
  Replaced with the verbatim compose `policy/{yashigani,v1_routing,rbac,
  agents}.rego` bundle so K8s and compose make the same policy decisions.
- **Compose — PKI bootstrap_token SHA-256 manifest mismatch** — the
  gateway failed closed with "Bootstrap token SHA-256 mismatch for 'gateway'"
  on macOS Podman because (a) `rotate_leaves()` discarded the recomputed
  hash return value and (b) Podman applehv's host→VM cp-back silently
  failed to update the host-side manifest. Fixed both: `rotate_leaves()`
  now persists the hash, and the install path verifies the host manifest
  matches the in-VM manifest before declaring the gateway ready.
- **Helm — bootstrap_token files in PKI Secret** — K8s PKI Secret now
  includes the `bootstrap_token` files referenced by OPA mTLS. Previously
  absent on K8s installs, which left the rotate-leaves path 503ing on
  upgrade. Skipped on K8s entrypoint where K8s-native mTLS handles
  identity binding.
- **Helm — `ollama-init` Job unblock** — three compounding K8s Job failures
  fixed: (1) the wait-for-ollama init container now uses a digest-pinned
  busybox image because the ollama image does not ship `wget` and the
  `/dev/tcp` shell probe is unreliable on K8s, (2) `allow-ollama-ingress`
  NetworkPolicy now permits ingress from the Job pod's labels, (3) new
  `allow-ollama-init-egress` NetworkPolicy permits DNS + ollama egress for
  the Job pod which was previously caught by `default-deny-egress`.
- **Open WebUI — network isolation + gateway connectivity** — Open WebUI
  joined the `caddy_internal` network; gateway connection uses HTTP (mesh
  port) not HTTPS to avoid certificate-of-internal-DN trust loops.
  `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` env wiring routes through
  the gateway with the in-mesh Bearer.
- **Open WebUI — RAG embeddings via Ollama; HuggingFace offline** —
  `RAG_EMBEDDING_ENGINE=ollama` + `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` +
  `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` so Open WebUI doesn't try to reach
  huggingface.co on startup in air-gapped installs.
- **Backoffice — WebAuthn service init signature** — `WebAuthnService.__init__`
  now correctly receives `config=WebAuthnConfig()` (was missing the
  positional argument, causing a deferred runtime crash on first WebAuthn
  registration attempt).
- **Linux aarch64 Podman rootless — template permission silent-noop** —
  `RUN chmod -R a+rX /usr/local/lib/python3.14/site-packages/yashigani/`
  added to gateway + backoffice Dockerfiles. Background: Podman rootless
  on Linux aarch64 silently drops the CAP_CHOWN that `pip install` relies
  on, leaving Python package files root:root mode 0640 — unreadable by the
  in-container yashigani UID 1001. Surface symptom was Jinja
  `TemplateNotFound` at first HTTP request.
- **Helm — Kyverno ClusterPolicy three bugs** — JMESPath expression
  malformed in one resource selector; `foreach` block referenced the wrong
  variable scope; APE rule referenced a field that may be absent on certain
  resource shapes. All three now fixed; admission-policies CI test exercises
  the corrected rules against fixtures.
- **Uninstall — wazuh-compose anonymous-volume leak** — wazuh add-on
  containers create anonymous volumes that survive `compose down -v`. The
  canonical uninstall volume list now includes them, plus a final
  `podman volume prune --filter dangling=true` pass.
- **Auth — `/auth/stepup` widened to accept user sessions** — previously
  only admin sessions could complete step-up TOTP verification. The
  `/me/api-key` self-service customer flow at `src/yashigani/backoffice/routes/me.py:215`
  requires `assert_fresh_stepup(session)`, but `/auth/stepup` at
  `auth.py:837` was gated to admin sessions only — making the customer
  feature unreachable for the user persona it was documented for.
  `AdminSession` → `AnySession` widens the dependency to accept any
  authenticated session while preserving every existing guard
  (anonymous-rejection, replay-cache, per-session failure counter at 5
  attempts, cross-tenant guard, audit-event emission). Closes a v2.23.4
  pre-tag finding (Gap B in `finding-me-api-key-unreachable.md`).
- **Caddy — `handle /me/*` block added to all 4 Caddyfiles** — compose
  selfsigned/acme/ca + the helm-rendered Caddyfile fragment now route
  `/me/*` to backoffice. Without this, `POST /me/api-key` returned HTTP
  405 from Caddy's default response (route was implemented in backoffice
  code but unreachable at the edge). Closes the other half of the
  pre-tag finding (Gap A in `finding-me-api-key-unreachable.md`). Each
  block matches its file-local `/auth/*` template — same mTLS,
  `inject-caddy-verified` HMAC, transport snippet.

### Security

- **SAML SP-key RSA enforcement at config-load** — non-RSA SP private keys
  rejected at `SAMLProvider.__init__`, preventing the EC-key path from
  reaching python3-saml. Mitigates the libgcrypt ECDH heap-overflow CVE
  class regardless of upstream patch availability.
- **python3-saml manual-re-audit gates** — `xmlparser.py` entity and
  DTD-resolution paths flagged for manual re-audit at every upstream bump.
- **Helm — `sslmode=require` fallback removed; fail-closed on misconfig**
  — `_build_ssl_context` in the partition-maintenance ConfigMap previously
  accepted `sslmode=require` (no server-cert validation). It now raises
  `ValueError` on any mode other than `verify-ca` / `verify-full` so a
  misconfigured DSN fails at startup rather than silently bypassing TLS
  certificate validation. New `validate-security.yaml` guard fails fast
  if `postgres.enabled=false` and `postgres.tls.ca` is unset in production
  or staging. 9-test regression suite at
  `tests/contracts/test_helm_sslmode.py`. Closes F-V232-002 (ASVS V14.4.1).
- **CI — gitleaks secret-scan workflow added** — `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml`
  runs `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@ff98106` (v2.3.9) against PR diffs and the
  full history on push to release branches. `.gitleaks.toml` config covers
  AWS / Stripe / private-key / generic-API-key / Yashigani-specific
  patterns. Historical false-positives captured in
  `gitleaks-baseline.json` so CI only fails on **new** leaks. Closes
  F-V232-003 (ASVS V10.3.4).
- **CI — Checkov IaC scan on Helm template output** —
  `.github/workflows/helm-iac-scan.yml` runs
  `bridgecrewio/checkov-action@4048c97` against `helm template` output
  across the default + external-postgres value matrices. Allowlist in
  `.checkov.yml` (101 entries; each cites a YSG-RISK ID or ARCH/CLUSTER
  classification — no uncited suppressions). Closes F-V232-004 (ASVS V12.5.1).
- **Trivy base-CVE hygiene — `apt-get -y upgrade` in both Dockerfiles**
  — `docker/Dockerfile.gateway` and `docker/Dockerfile.backoffice` now
  run `apt-get -y upgrade` between `apt-get update` and `apt-get install`,
  so image builds pull Debian trixie security-updated base packages
  rather than only the snapshot baked into the `python:3.14.0-slim` base.
  Closes CVE-2026-29111 (systemd) and CVE-2026-4878 (libcap2) on both
  images. Remaining 3 CVEs (CVE-2025-69720 ncurses, CVE-2026-41989
  libgcrypt, CVE-2026-6732 libxml2) are all NOT-EXPLOITABLE-CVA per
  pre-existing verdicts independent of package version. Trivy rescan
  verdict: `testing_runs/yashigani_trivy_rescan_20260517/verdict.md`.
- **Admin/user tier separation regression test** — covered with a real
  fakeredis-backed integration test exercising the production registration
  path (not a mock).

### Changed

- **Version bumped 2.23.3 → 2.23.4** across `pyproject.toml`, `install.sh`,
  `docker-compose.yml` defaults, helm `values.yaml`, `airgap/manifest.yml`,
  and `AI_ASSETS.md`. The v2.23.4 branch was cut from v2.23.3 tip without
  the initial version bump; this closes the drift so `install.sh` against
  v2.23.4 source builds and deploys v2.23.4-tagged containers (rather than
  silently building `:2.23.3`-tagged ones from v2.23.4 code).

### CI / Tooling

- **Caddyfile family parity gate** — new workflow runs `caddy adapt` against
  each compose Caddyfile variant (`acme`, `ca`, `selfsigned`) plus the
  helm-rendered Caddyfile fragment, asserts exit 0, and verifies per-listener
  directive parity across the compose variants. Adds a `service_identities.yaml`
  dedup check (single source of truth via symlink) and a Helm env-var parity
  check that catches the gateway-DSN-DIRECT class of regression.
- **OpenAPI schema drift gate** (`api-docs-drift` CI job) — regenerates
  `docs/api/*.md` from the live FastAPI schema and fails the build if the
  committed markdown has drifted. Catches schema changes that aren't reflected
  in the published API reference.

### Documentation

- **API reference docs** (`docs/api/`) — three markdown files generated from
  the live OpenAPI schema: `gateway-api.md` (operator/agent-facing),
  `admin-api.md` (backoffice management plane), `auth-api.md` (shared auth
  endpoints). `docs/api/README.md` index links all three. Files are regenerated
  by `scripts/gen_api_docs.py` and drift-checked in CI.
- **Architecture cleanup** — removed unimplemented bare-metal install claims
  from `Architecture.md`. Bare-metal install was design intent that never
  shipped code.
- **`iptables FORWARD` precondition** for rootful Podman installs on test
  VMs documented (production hosts with sane FORWARD policy unaffected).
- **SHA-256-compatible authenticator app guidance** in post-install message
  — Yashigani uses HMAC-SHA-256 per the SHA-256 minimum policy; apps that
  ignore the `algorithm` parameter (e.g. older Google Authenticator) silently
  default to SHA-1 and produce wrong codes.

### Breaking Changes — review before upgrade from v2.23.3

- **OPA fail-closed posture** (`318a3db` + `f720857`) — the OPA response-check
  in `src/yashigani/gateway/openai_router.py` now returns
  `allow: False` on EVERY exception path (timeout, 5xx response, connection
  refused, `opa_not_configured`) instead of the prior `allow: True`. Helm
  enforces it at deploy-time via the `OPA-URL-001` violation when
  `global.environment=production` and `gateway.env.YASHIGANI_OPA_URL` is
  empty. **Operational impact:** an OPA outage now causes inference requests
  to be denied until OPA recovers, instead of silently allowing all traffic
  through. This is the correct zero-trust posture per the project's
  zero-trust default, but it IS a behavioural break for operators upgrading
  from v2.23.3 with intermittently-reachable OPA. Alert on
  `yashigani_opa_response_check_failures_total` rate (new Prometheus counter
  registered in `metrics/registry.py`) to spot OPA reachability issues early.
  Dev opt-in: set `YASHIGANI_OPA_OPTIONAL=true` AND keep `YASHIGANI_ENV` out
  of production / staging to preserve the prior fail-open behaviour during
  local development.

### Security (post-FINDING-002 addendum 2026-05-18)

These entries were added after the Iris third-pass audit caught CHANGELOG
drift on the rebased branch. They cover the post-FINDING-001 work:

- **`yashigani-internal` Bearer rotated to per-install secret** (`514316d`
  gateway env-var read + `27d46ab` `install.sh` token generation +
  compose+helm secret wiring on the pre-rebase `fcc551a`). The literal
  string `yashigani-internal` is gone from production source. `install.sh`
  generates a 36-char charset-compliant token at install time, written to
  `docker/secrets/yashigani_internal_bearer` at mode 0600; Helm equivalent
  via the `yashigani-agent-bearer` Secret with upgrade-safe `lookup`.
  Compose entrypoint shims export the secret to `OPENAI_API_KEY` for Open
  WebUI + Langflow + Letta service consumers. Gateway compare uses
  `hmac.compare_digest`. Closes the Captain gitleaks-baseline Bucket-C
  finding from 2026-05-17.
- **`OPA_RESPONSE_CHECK_FAILED` audit-event type added** (`src/yashigani/audit/schema.py`,
  shipped in `318a3db`). New Prometheus counter
  `yashigani_opa_response_check_failures_total{outcome, reason}` registered
  at module load.
- **`account_tier` audit-accuracy comprehensive sweep** — across the
  v2.23.4 close-out the audit-event constructors in `src/yashigani/backoffice/routes/auth.py`
  and additional `_config_event` / `_full_reset_event` / similar helpers in
  `users.py`, `accounts.py`, `audit.py`, `ratelimit.py`, `inspection.py`,
  `kms.py`, `pg_auth.py`, `webauthn_v1.py` were widened to derive
  `account_tier` from the session/account record instead of hardcoding
  `"admin"`. With `/auth/stepup` now widened to accept user sessions, the
  hardcode would otherwise have written user-tier step-ups to audit log as
  admin-tier events (ASVS V7.3.4). Commits: `9007e11`, `9a50285`,
  `8682695`, `b55c8f1`, `c04627f`, `2379d19`.
- **Anonymous-caller upstream rejection** (`318a3db` step 1b). On
  `/v1/chat/completions` and adjacent inference endpoints, an unauthenticated
  caller is now rejected with HTTP 401 BEFORE the OPA response-check is
  reached. Previously, an `identity is None` caller would short-circuit the
  OPA check entirely via the `if _state.opa_url and identity` guard at
  line 1010; that guard is now `if _state.opa_url` because identity is
  guaranteed non-None by the new upstream gate. The `yashigani-internal`
  Bearer presents `kind=service` identity and passes the upstream gate
  unaffected.

### CI / Tooling — post-FINDING-002 addendum

- **`acs-v3-hardcoded-bearer-auth-bypass`** rule shipped on the ACS side
  (CWE-798, ASVS V6.3.2, OWASP A07:2021, OWASP API API2, NIST IA-5, CMMC
  IA.L2-3.5.2). Detects `if token == "<literal>"` / `if key in ("<literal>",)`
  / `hmac.compare_digest(<var>, "<literal>")` / lowercase-normalised
  comparisons / direct config-template literal assignments in
  auth-handling paths. Wired into 19 of 20 framework files (ACS rc2). New
  detection-lane that would have caught the `yashigani-internal` literal
  before it shipped.
- **Laura red-team brief template** now includes a STANDING credential-audit
  lane (Lane A — 10 hardcoded-credential pattern classes; Lane B — 5
  JWT/session probes). Non-optional on every pre-release dispatch
  henceforth. Template at
  `Internal/Compliance/yashigani/templates/laura-pre-release-brief-template.md`.

### Documentation — post-FINDING-002 addendum

- **OPA fail-closed operator runbook** — `_opa_response_check` docstring
  in `openai_router.py` now describes the new fail-closed behaviour, the
  audit-event emission, the Prometheus counter, and the operator response
  when an OPA outage causes denials. Replaces the prior misleading
  docstring that claimed audit coverage that did not actually fire (Iris
  FINDING-001, closed in `9007e11`).
- **CHANGELOG addendum trail** — Iris third-pass FINDING-005 caught that
  the post-FINDING-002 addendum at `fa506e2` did not cover 10 subsequent
  commits. This block closes that gap. Lesson saved to
  `feedback_detection_lane_parity_audit.md` (one audit lane catches a
  class — every other lane must demonstrate it would catch the same class
  or document the gap).

### Security (tag close-out addendum 2026-05-21 — Batches 1+2+3 + cleanup-system architectural close)

These entries cover the final pre-tag arc: 16 commits between `b03029f` and
`03dd494` closing the v2.23.4 backlog. Iris+Laura review-first pattern
executed across 10+ design+threat-model cycles (docs persisted at
`internal-docs/yashigani/iris-v234-*.md` + `laura-v234-*.md`). Ava E2E
13/13 PASS at tip `03dd494` (Phase 1 6/6 + Phase 2 6/6 + crucible test of
the cross-UID `.env` class-of-bug close). All YSG-RISK entries triaged
through Iris+Laura independent reviews; 7 register items confirmed CLOSED
on triage; the cleanup-system architectural class fully closed.

- **`letta-pgbouncer` mTLS sidecar** — letta's postgres connection now
  routes through a dedicated `letta-pgbouncer` session-mode sidecar
  (`edoburu/pgbouncer:v1.25.1-p0`, UID 70, `read_only:true`, `cap_drop:[ALL]`,
  `no-new-privileges`). The sidecar presents `letta-pgbouncer_client.crt`
  to postgres over mTLS; the postgres `pg_hba.conf` catch-all
  (`hostssl all all 0.0.0.0/0 scram-sha-256 clientcert=verify-ca`) applies
  uniformly with no letta carveout. asyncpg+pg8000 limitation (cannot
  present client certs via URI params) is closed at the sidecar boundary.
  Closes YSG-RISK-048 (was MEDIUM open through Phase 3 arc).
- **pgbouncer `auth_type=plain` posture documented as non-KMS-only**
  (YSG-RISK-049 ACCEPTED-LOW). The cleartext userlist.txt is the expected
  posture for the non-KMS dev/standalone deployment scenario. Production
  deployments configure a KMS provider via `YASHIGANI_KMS_PROVIDER=vault|azure|
  aws|gcp|keeper` which fetches credentials at runtime via the abstractions
  in `src/yashigani/kms/` — the cleartext userlist.txt path is bypassed
  entirely in KMS-configured deployments. Documented at
  `docs/yashigani_install_config.md` §6.1.
- **YSG-SECRETS-DIST-002 LOW filed** — GID 2002 (numeric, no `/etc/group`
  entry) full-bind-mount cross-secret read. Compromised container with GID
  2002 supplementary can read all three shared secrets, not just the one
  it needs. Forward-close target v2.24.0 via per-consumer credentials.
  No exploit chain in v2.23.4 (compensating control: cap_drop:ALL +
  read_only:true rootfs + container-boundary trust posture).
- **pgbouncer admin console lockdown** — both yashigani-pgbouncer and
  letta-pgbouncer `pgbouncer.ini` now set `admin_users =` empty and
  `stats_users =` empty, disabling the admin console (was inadvertently
  open to `yashigani_app` cred on yashigani-pgbouncer). Closes Laura F2
  finding from the Batch 3 threat-model.

### Fixed (tag close-out addendum 2026-05-21)

- **Cleanup-system architectural close — state file + container-fallback rm
  + cross-UID handlers across install/uninstall.** Root cause of five
  cascading uninstall/clean-slate blockers: install.sh and uninstall.sh
  shared a working directory but shared no persisted state, forcing every
  cleanup heuristic (runtime detect, ownership assumption, stale-dir
  detection) to guess. Architectural close:
  - **State file** `docker/.yashigani-install-state` (mode 0644, key=value:
    `RUNTIME`, `INSTALL_UID`, `INSTALL_USER`, `INSTALL_TIMESTAMP`,
    `YASHIGANI_VERSION`) written by install.sh at install completion.
    Mode 0644 is correct (0600 would re-introduce the cross-UID problem).
    `.gitignore` entry added.
  - **uninstall.sh reads state file before auto-detect** — state-file
    `RUNTIME` value beats `podman info`/`docker info` heuristic on
    dual-runtime hosts. Falls back to auto-detect if state file absent
    (backwards-compatible with pre-v2.23.4 installs).
  - **Container-fallback rm for `docker/{data,certs,logs}`** — when host-side
    `rm -rf` fails on chown'd dirs (cycle-3 install-side chown to 1001:1001),
    fall back to `podman unshare rm` → ephemeral runtime container `rm -rf
    /t/*`. No sudo required.
  - **Sudo-free secrets wipe** (`BACKLOG-V240-006` closed) — `sudo rm -rf
    docker/secrets/*` silently failed on non-PTY SSH. Replaced with the
    same three-tier fallback (direct → `podman unshare` → container-root
    `rm` against `docker/secrets:/t:rw`). Hard WARN on all-fail (no silent
    swallow). `${_ALPINE_IMAGE:?...}` guard against unset variable.
  - **Dotfile-aware wipe glob** — bare `rm -rf /t/*` does NOT match
    dotfiles. `.pki-status` (written by `_pki_run_issuer`) survived the
    wipe → `rmdir` then failed → blocker re-manifested. All three wipe
    tiers updated to POSIX-portable glob: `rm -rf /t/* /t/.[!.]* /t/..?*`
    (matches dotfiles excluding `.` and `..`; works in Alpine `sh`).
  - **`rmdir` after content wipe** — empty `docker/secrets/` dir rmdir
    works regardless of host owner; closes the stale-dir blocker.
  - **`uninstall.sh` `log_info` helper** — was missing from uninstall.sh,
    breaking the state-file detect block under `set -euo pipefail`. Helper
    restored.
  - **`.env` cross-UID handler** — `BUG-UNINSTALL-PARTIAL-ENV` now
    skip-with-WARN on unreadable `.env` (test-infra contamination scenario
    where a prior install ran as a different UID and wrote `docker/.env`
    as `root:root`). `docker compose down` proceeds via Docker socket
    without host-side `.env` read; `--env-file /dev/null` + process-env
    stubs satisfy `:?` declarations. Three `.env` read sites guarded.
  - **`_do_chgrp` hoisted to script scope** — bash nested-function bug
    where `_do_chgrp` was defined inside `_pki_chown_client_keys()` but
    called from `generate_secrets()` (earlier in install sequence) →
    `command not found` under `set -euo pipefail`. Lifted to top-level
    helper; sibling check confirmed `_do_chown` and `_do_chmod_dir` are
    still nested-only-callers from within `_pki_chown_client_keys`.
- **pgbouncer entrypoint CMD chain restored** — the MD5 shim experiment
  ended with `exec /entrypoint.sh` (no args). edoburu's entrypoint last
  line is `exec "$@"` — with empty `$@`, exec exits cleanly without
  launching pgbouncer. Fixed in all four sites (compose × 2 services +
  helm template + values.yaml sidecar): `exec /entrypoint.sh pgbouncer
  /etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini` restored.
- **pgbouncer `auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt` directive restored
  in all three ini files** (`docker/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini`,
  `docker/pgbouncer/pgbouncer-letta.ini`,
  `helm/yashigani/files/pgbouncer.ini`). The SCRAM-revert dropped the
  directive entirely instead of restoring its pre-SCRAM value, leaving
  pgbouncer with no user lookup mechanism even though userlist.txt was on
  disk.
- **Air-gap install Step 9 image-digest verification** — `docker load`
  does not populate `RepoDigests`, so the prior verification loop reported
  silent `0 image(s) verified`. `scripts/prepare-airgap-bundle.sh` now
  captures `docker inspect --format '{{.Id}}'` at bundle-build time and
  writes an `id:` field into each manifest entry; install.sh verification
  falls back to `.Id` (content-addressable SHA-256) when `RepoDigests` is
  empty. Backwards-compatible for pre-extension manifests (warn-and-skip;
  bundle SHA + helm/compose digest-pin remain primary integrity controls).
  Closes YSG-RISK-038 / BUG-AG-003.
- **`install.sh:5101` `|| true` guard on podman cp fallback** — the
  compose-cp/podman-cp fallback chain at lines 5100-5101 had `|| true`
  on the subsequent exec lines but not on the cp fallback itself. When
  open-webui is absent from `COMPOSE_PROFILES` (e.g.,
  `--agent-bundles letta,langflow` without `all`), the cp tried to copy
  into a non-existent container and hung indefinitely under
  `set -euo pipefail`. Closes the Ava-found Phase 1 cp-hang.
- **uninstall.sh runtime detection prefers Podman with liveness probe** —
  was misdetecting runtime as Docker on Podman-only VMs (and via
  symmetrical inversion on dual-runtime hosts), calling `docker volume rm`
  against Podman volumes which silently no-oped. Detection now uses
  `podman info` liveness probe first, `docker info` fallback. Operator
  `--runtime=` override preserved. Closes BACKLOG-V240-004.
- **uninstall.sh chown container-fallback for `docker/{data,certs,logs}`** —
  mirror of install-side cycle-3 container-fallback pattern. Closes
  BACKLOG-V240-003.

### Changed (tag close-out addendum 2026-05-21)

- **Dead-code `fasttext_backend.py` removed** — `src/yashigani/inspection/backends/fasttext_backend.py`
  deleted; was a 130-line vestigial leftover from the v2.23.3 fasttext→sklearn
  swap (`e966e55`). Zero live imports verified before removal (collected
  2511 tests collected with no import errors). Closes LU-YSG-009.
- **Air-gap install docs (`docs/operations/air-gap-install.md`)** — `config/`
  added to Step 2 transfer file list (closes YSG-RISK-039 / BUG-AG-004);
  v2.23.3 version refs swept to v2.23.4 in the same docs commit.

### Documentation — tag close-out addendum

- **KMS posture note** at `docs/yashigani_install_config.md` §6.1 — clarifies
  that the cleartext userlist.txt is the non-KMS dev/standalone posture and
  that production deployments configure `YASHIGANI_KMS_PROVIDER=vault|azure|aws|
  gcp|keeper` to bypass the cleartext-on-disk path entirely. Captures the
  YSG-RISK-049 architectural framing.

### YSG-RISK register — tag close-out state

- **CLOSED via tag close-out work:** YSG-RISK-048 (letta postgres mTLS via
  pgbouncer sidecar), BACKLOG-V240-003 (uninstaller chown), BACKLOG-V240-004
  (uninstaller runtime detect), BACKLOG-V240-006 (sudo secrets wipe), and
  the cleanup-system class root cause (state file + cross-UID handlers).
- **CLOSED via Iris+Laura triage:** YSG-RISK-013 (SPIFFE ACL TTL — closed
  since April), YSG-RISK-014 (OIDC acr/amr — closed since April), YSG-RISK-036
  (PR #71 CVE chain — Laura-validated CLOSED), YSG-RISK-040 (fasttext —

  in both Dockerfiles), YSG-RISK-007 (SSRF — register heading reconciled,
  6 sites closed via 84aab78/64ec325/1209055).
- **ACCEPTED-LOW non-customer-scenario in v2.23.4:** YSG-RISK-049 (pgbouncer
  userlist.txt cleartext — non-KMS deployment posture; production KMS path
  bypasses). YSG-SECRETS-DIST-002 (GID 2002 cross-secret-read — forward-close
  v2.24.0 per-consumer creds).
- **Forward-tracked to v2.24.0 backlog** (explicit Tiago sign-off + named
  forward-close target per `feedback_debt_before_features` rule):
  BACKLOG-V240-001 (uvicorn → granian/hypercorn ASGI swap, closes
  YSG-RISK-012b + YSG-RISK-047 + YSG-RISK-013 partial; Iris+Laura
  second-opinion validated 3-5 days realistic effort), BACKLOG-V240-002
  (`_do_chown` top-level shared helper refactor).

>
### Added

- **feat/v233-issue-91-ssrf-pinned-resolver** — DNS-rebinding defence for outbound HTTP
  (`yashigani.net.pinned_resolver`). Resolves the target hostname once at context entry,
  verifies the IP against the SSRF allowlist/blocklist, and patches `socket.getaddrinfo`
  for the transport so subsequent DNS changes cannot redirect the connection. OWUI agent
  push (`backoffice/routes/agents.py _push_openwebui_model`) wired through pinned-resolver
  to defend against admin-account-compromise pivot. Closes OWASP API7 SSRF DNS-rebinding
  gap (issue #91). New exports: `pinned_resolver` via `yashigani.net`. New audit event type
  `SSRF_PINNED_RESOLVER_USED` (DEBUG). New security doc `docs/security/ssrf.md`. 18 new tests
  in `src/tests/security/test_dns_rebinding.py` + 8 OWUI tests in `test_owui_dns_rebinding.py`.
- **feat/v233-pki-bundle** — PKI admin UI (`/api/v1/admin/pki/*`) and BYO-CA driver (`YASHIGANI_PKI_CA_MODE=byo`). Closes #51 + #53.
  - Admin endpoints: `GET /chain/{service}` (cert detail + SHA-256 fingerprint), `POST /rotate/{service}` (step-up TOTP, ASVS V6.8.4), `GET /bundle/{service}` (PEM download, private key never included / CWE-200), `GET /status` (all-services overview).
  - BYO-CA driver: EC P-256 CSR generation → HTTPS signing endpoint (step-ca / Vault PKI) → chain validation → atomic key install. Auth modes: `token`, `mtls`, `none`. Fail-closed: `DriverError` on any failure — no silent fallback to internal issuer.
  - Service name regex `[a-z][a-z0-9_\-]{0,63}$` — path traversal prevention. Body limit 256 bytes (ASVS 4.3.1). Audit events: `PKI_CERT_ROTATED`, `PKI_CERT_ROTATION_FAILED`.
  - 23 new unit tests (PKI-D-01…12, PKI-R-01…11). 10 Playwright e2e tests (PW-PKI-01…10).
  - Driver abstraction: `yashigani.pki.drivers.{base,internal_ca,byo_ca}` + `yashigani.pki.driver_factory`.

- **chore(helm): customer-builds pattern for own images** — `helm/yashigani/values.yaml`
  `adminBootstrap.image`, `gateway.image`, and `backoffice.image` now use tag-only references
  (`yashigani-gateway:2.23.3`, `yashigani-backoffice:2.23.3`) with no registry prefix and no
  digest pin. Agnostic Security does not build or distribute gateway/backoffice images;
  operators build locally via `install.sh` from the v2.23.3 tagged source (compose path), or
  build and push to their own private registry for K8s deployments — matching the air-gap
  design from PR #114. Operators running K8s should update the `repository` field to their
  registry path and add `@sha256:<digest>` for supply-chain attestation. Third-party images
  (caddy, redis, opa, grafana, etc.) remain pinned to `name:tag@sha256:<digest>` as before.

### Security (v2.23.3)

- **feat/v233-issue-58-airgap** — Air-gap deployment support: operators build an offline bundle from a pinned `airgap/manifest.yml` on a connected host via `scripts/prepare-airgap-bundle.sh`, transfer it to the isolated host, and install with `install.sh --air-gap --bundle <path>`. Supply-chain design: Agnostic Security ships only the manifest (kilobytes); customers pull from upstream registries under their own attestation chain. Bundle assembly: per-profile selection (core/full/observability/agents/wazuh/spire); per-image digest verification fail-closed at pull and at load; `zstd`-compressed tar; SHA256 sidecar manifest for out-of-band integrity check. Installer changes: `--air-gap` + `--bundle` flags; bundle SHA256 verified against sidecar; each loaded image digest verified against `airgap/manifest.yml`; all outbound fetches (registry, HIBP, ACME) blocked; `--air-gap` implies `--offline` + `--tls-mode selfsigned`. Pre-flight G20 gate: bundle existence, manifest presence + parse, zstd availability, sidecar presence (warn). HIBP skipped in air-gap mode with operator guidance for manual rotation. Docs: `docs/operations/air-gap-install.md`. Tests: `tests/install/test_air_gap.sh` (negative, dry-run, manifest schema, Linux netns). Closes #58.
- **feat/v233-issue-90-bopla** — API3 BOPLA per-property allowlist audit (#90): adds explicit deny-by-default public-view Pydantic schemas (`AdminAccountPublic`, `UserAccountPublic`, `SiemTargetPublic`, `IdPPublic`, `JWTConfigPublic`, `JWTTestResultPublic`) backed by `model_config extra='forbid'`. List endpoints for admin/user accounts now route through these schemas, guaranteeing `password_hash`, `totp_secret`, `recovery_codes`, `failed_attempts`, `locked_until`, `totp_failed_attempts`, `totp_backoff_until` are never serialised. SIEM target list explicitly excludes `auth_value` (bearer/HEC token). SSO IdP list excludes `client_secret`, `client_id`, `private_key`, `signing_cert`, `org_id`. JWT test result filtered via `SAFE_JWT_CLAIMS` allowlist stripping `email`, `phone_number`, `given_name`, `family_name`, `address` and other PII claims. One-time-delivery exceptions (admin/user create, agent register/rotate) documented in `docs/security/bopla-allowlist.md`. 54 regression tests in `test_v2233_bopla_allowlist.py`. OWASP API3:2023, ASVS V4.2.1, CWE-213.

- **feat/v233-backup-encryption** — `scripts/backup.sh` (new) produces age-encrypted `<timestamp>.tar.gz.age` backups via AES-256-GCM (age X25519). `restore.sh` extended with `--encrypted <identity.age> <archive>` path; legacy unencrypted archives accepted with deprecation warning. `age=1.2.1-1+b5` added to both Dockerfiles. Helm chart adds `backup-cronjob.yaml` CronJob + `backup-script` ConfigMap + values for `backup.recipientKeyConfigMap` / `backup.identitySecret`. `scripts/preflight.sh` Gate G19: age binary + recipient key validation. `docs/operations/backup.md` new Encryption section with key generation, rotation runbook, and K8s setup. Closes MP.L2-3.8.9 (CMMC L2 product gap) / CWE-312.
- **feat/v233-password-history** — Password reuse history (CMMC L2 IA.L2-3.5.8 / NIST SP 800-63B §5.1.1.2): self-service password changes now check the new password against the last `PASSWORD_HISTORY_DEPTH` (default 12, range 1–24) Argon2id hashes in the new `password_history` table (migration `0010`). Reuse rejected HTTP 422 `password_reuse`. On rejection emits `PASSWORD_REUSE_REJECTED` audit event with `user_id` and `history_depth_checked` — no password or hash ever logged. History pruned to `depth` entries per user after each successful change. Closes CMMC L2 product gap IA.L2-3.5.8.
- **fix/agents-urllib-through-httpclient** — `backoffice/routes/agents.py _push_openwebui_model()` previously used a hand-rolled `_assert_safe_owui_url()` with an inline SSRF allowlist (scheme check + `YASHIGANI_OWUI_HOSTNAMES` host allowlist). Replaced with a lazy singleton `_owui_http_client()` (HttpClient, `allow_http=True`, `YASHIGANI_OWUI_HOSTNAMES`-driven allowlist). `BlockedByPolicy` is caught and converted to `RuntimeError` (non-fatal). The hand-rolled helper is removed (yashigani-retro#95 / OWASP A10 / API7 SSRF).
- **extend-pr-112-owui-wrap** — OWUI agent push now uses `pinned_resolver` (DNS-rebinding defence against admin-account-compromise pivot). OWUI hostnames are admin-configurable per agent and can be attacker-influenced via licence-key compromise or admin-account takeover; `_push_openwebui_model()` now resolves the OWUI hostname once at context entry, verifies the IP, and pins the transport — subsequent DNS changes cannot redirect the connection. Replaces `urllib.request` with `httpx` via `pinned_resolver`. `SSRF_PINNED_RESOLVER_USED` logged at DEBUG on each OWUI push. New tests in `src/tests/security/test_owui_dns_rebinding.py` (OWASP API7 / issue #91).
- **fix/hibp-route-through-httpclient** — `auth/password.py check_hibp()` now routes through `HttpClient._check_policy()` with `allowlist=["api.pwnedpasswords.com"]` and `allow_http=False` before issuing the outbound HIBP request. The URL is hardcoded (no immediate SSRF risk), but defence-in-depth ensures any future change to `_HIBP_API_URL` is automatically caught by the centralised gate. Fail-open preserved: `BlockedByPolicy` → `return None`. The `_check_hibp_urllib` fallback is only invoked after the policy gate passes (yashigani-retro#95 / OWASP A10 / API7 SSRF).
- **fix/auth-logout-audit-emit** — `routes/auth.py logout()` now emits an `AdminLoginEvent(outcome="logout")` audit event before returning. Every other auth lifecycle outcome (login success/failure, totp_provision, stepup, self_reset) was already audited; logout was the only gap (yashigani-retro#95 / OWASP A09 / CMMC AU.L2-3.3.1). Guarded by `if state.audit_writer is not None` for partial-init safety.
- **fix/break-glass-audit-writer-required** — `auth/break_glass.py init_break_glass(audit_writer=None)` default removed; `audit_writer` is now a required positional argument. Calling without it raises `TypeError` at startup rather than silently creating an audit-silent break-glass manager. The one call site (`backoffice/entrypoint.py:474`) already passes `audit_writer` explicitly — no functional change there. `_emit_activated` and `_emit_expired` None-guards preserved for defence-in-depth (yashigani-retro#95 / OWASP A09 / CMMC AU.L2-3.3.1).
- **feat/v233-issue-95-product-gaps** (#95) — 5 ACS-surfaced product gaps closed: (1) *auth_log*: four new `EventType` variants (`AUTH_LOGIN_ATTEMPT`, `ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT`, `PASSWORD_CHANGED`, `SESSIONS_INVALIDATED`) + matching dataclasses in `audit/schema.py`; login-attempt events emitted at the route layer, lockout events emitted from `pg_auth.authenticate()` via a non-blocking `_emit_lockout_event()` helper; password-change and session-invalidation events emitted in `routes/auth.py change_password()` and `self_service_password_reset()`. (2) *Injection (SCIM)*: SCIM `?filter=` param now declared as typed `Query(max_length=256)` — FastAPI enforces length at the framework layer before any Python code runs; `_parse_filter_email()` enhanced with an explicit email regex (`_EMAIL_RE`) rejecting any value that is not a valid RFC 5321 address. (3) *BFLA*: `manage_service()` re-parameterised from `AdminSession` → `StepUpAdminSession`; enabling or disabling a compose-profile service now requires a fresh TOTP step-up (ASVS V6.8.4 / CMMC AC.L2-3.1.1). (4) *3rd-party response validation*: HIBP k-Anonymity response lines validated against `_HIBP_LINE_RE` (`^[0-9A-F]{35}:[0-9]+$`) before `int()` conversion — malformed lines logged and skipped rather than raising `ValueError`; OIDC discovery documents validated by `_validate_oidc_metadata()` (required fields: `issuer`, `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, `jwks_uri`; all must be non-empty `https://` strings) before being cached. (5) *CMMC AC.L2-3.1.1*: same root-cause fix as Gap 3 — `StepUpAdminSession` on `manage_service()`. 65 new unit tests in `tests/unit/test_v2233_acs_product_gaps.py`.

### Changed (v2.23.3)

- **fix(deps): replace `fasttext-wheel` with `scikit-learn` in sensitivity classifier** (PR #131, commit `e966e55`) — the PII/sensitivity classifier ML backend was swapped from `fasttext-wheel` (Facebook supervised text classifier) to a `scikit-learn` TF-IDF + LogisticRegression joblib pipeline. **Motivation:** `fasttext-wheel` was last uploaded 2020-09-03, archived by maintainer 2024-03-22, and its Python ABI pin blocked the ≤3.12 upgrade path. **scikit-learn** has no ABI constraint, ships pre-built wheels across all currently-supported Python versions, and the joblib artefact is ~28 KB vs ~1-2 MB FastText `.bin`. **Quality:** macro F1 0.9545 on the 220-example training corpus (no regression vs FastText on the same corpus). **API compat:** the surrounding-code slot name `fasttext_backend` is preserved as a backward-compat variable name; the implementation class is now `SklearnBackend` in `src/yashigani/inspection/backends/sklearn_backend.py`. **Build:** trainer Docker stage installs `scikit-learn>=1.4` + `joblib>=1.3` and bakes `sensitivity_classifier.joblib` at image build time. Docs updated: `Architecture.md`, `README.md`, `AI_ASSETS.md` §3.2.

## [v2.23.2.1] — 2026-05-08 — Helm chart digest pin fix

> **Chart-only patch. Code (gateway + backoffice binaries) is identical to v2.23.2.**
>
> **Tag:** `v2.23.2.1` → SHA `49b80fd` — [GitHub Release](https://github.com/agnosticsec-com/yashigani/releases/tag/v2.23.2.1)

### Fixed

- **(#77) Helm chart — image digest pointers corrected** — `helm/yashigani/values.yaml` referenced v2.23.1 image digests for `yashigani-gateway` and `yashigani-backoffice` after the v2.23.2 GA tag was cut. This caused Kubernetes Helm deployments to pull the v2.23.1 container images when running the v2.23.2 chart, producing a chart/binary version mismatch that was invisible to operators. The patch pins both images to the correct v2.23.2 GA digests:
  - `yashigani-gateway:2.23.2@sha256:7ffe5b92b23224a5fdcf86bf2570345d979ca2f9f06beda52447efc6ef5b688c`
  - `yashigani-backoffice:2.23.2@sha256:34f4e68dac35f6e045bfe6277cd9725340e0e662361cdfb81b2057d3a0ebd0dc`

  **Upgrade path:** Helm users on v2.23.2 should upgrade to v2.23.2.1 immediately (`helm upgrade --version 2.23.2.1`). No image rebuild or config change needed. Docker / Podman Compose deployments are unaffected (image pins in `docker-compose.release.yml` were already correct).

## [v2.23.2] — 2026-05-06

Theme: **Security Hardening + Supply-Chain Controls + ASVS L3 92% + Agentic AI Overreliance Controls**.

### Today's batch (2026-05-06)

- **#44** `72a93fa` — feat(security): OWASP Agentic AI T10 overreliance UX controls (F-T10-001) — three `X-Yashigani-*` response headers on every LLM/agent response; `math.isfinite` NaN/Inf clamp; env-var fallback on threshold; 16 regression tests
- **#43** `43ef0fa` — fix(images): pin all external images to multi-arch manifest INDEX digests — closes Podman parity P-8 (aarch64 exec-format crash) and smoke-gate V232-SMOKE-001
- **#47** `2b65b0a` — fix(install): non-interactive bind-mount mkdir — `install.sh` pre-creates bind-mount dirs; no sudo in installer body
- **#46** `8aacdae` — feat(uninstall): `--yes` / `-y` flag for unattended removal
- **#50** `39f6fee` — chore(release): Gate 6a specialist-per-language review codified in pre-flight checklist
- **#45** `057faa4` — chore(helm): grafana 12.4.3 → 13.0.1 + close `helm/charts/grafana/values.yaml` "latest" pinning gap
- **#52** `10864bd` — fix(compose): Podman healthcheck silent-drop (P-9) — rebased replacement for #49

### Previous batch (2026-05-03)

### Breaking Changes

- **Breaking default behaviour:** `RATE_LIMITER_FAIL_MODE` now defaults to `closed`. On Redis unavailability, the gateway returns HTTP 503 + Retry-After (auto-heal typically under 2 minutes) instead of silently passing traffic. High-availability operators who require pre-2.23.2 fail-open behaviour can opt back in by setting `RATE_LIMITER_FAIL_MODE=open` in the gateway environment. (F-LLM06-001)

### Security

- **XFF spoofing** — Caddy strips and re-sets `X-Forwarded-For` at the edge; rate limiting and audit logging now bind to the Caddy-observed address, not caller-supplied headers.
- **Rate limiter fail-closed default** — `RATE_LIMITER_FAIL_MODE` now defaults to `closed`; Redis errors produce `HTTP 503` + `Retry-After: 5` rather than silent allow-through. Fail-open opt-in is documented for operators who need it. Customer-facing recovery message included.
- **Login throttle `Retry-After` header** — RFC 6585-compliant `Retry-After` on 429/401 throttle responses; closes the locked-out operator information gap deferred from v2.23.1.
- **OPA and Jaeger mTLS** — Both services now require mutual TLS in Docker Compose and Kubernetes Helm deployments; plaintext access from the data plane is no longer possible.
- **Kyverno admission policies** — Kubernetes deployments enforce non-root UID, read-only root filesystem, no privilege escalation, and dropped capabilities at the admission level; policy violations block pod scheduling.
- **Ollama UID 1000** — Ollama inference service migrated from root to UID 1000, closing the last root-in-container exception.
- **All 73 Caddy `reverse_proxy` blocks gated** — `X-Caddy-Verified-Secret` injected on every `reverse_proxy` block across all Caddyfile variants and the Kubernetes ConfigMap. Asserted by contract test in CI.
- **Backslash open-redirect patch** — `next=` parameter in the admin login flow now rejects backslash-encoded path bypass variants. Regression test suite covers the known bypass patterns.
- **Safe error envelopes** — All backoffice and gateway error responses go through `safe_error_envelope`; exception class names and stack details are stripped from customer-visible responses.
- **GPG release tag signing** — Signing infrastructure complete: CI workflow (`tag-sign.yml`), one-time key ceremony procedure, and public key (`docs/release-signing-key.asc`) all landed. `git tag -v v2.23.2` verifies the signature.
- **SSRF on alert webhook** — Host allowlist enforced on webhook SSRF guard in addition to the v2.23.1 SSRF batch.

### Supply Chain

- **GitHub Actions SHA pinning** — All workflow steps pinned to digest, not mutable tag.
- **`pip` removed from runtime images** — Eliminates pip CVE surface in production containers; package installs are build-time only.
- **SBOM service-identity SHA gate** — SBOM generation now includes a content-hash assertion on `service_identities.yaml`.
- **Trivy CI digest annotation** — Every Trivy scan annotates the job summary with the exact image digest scanned, creating an auditable linkage between scan result and image content.
- **CI `/tmp` path lint gate** — A CI check rejects any code path that writes to host `/tmp`; `RUNNER_TEMP` and working-directory temporaries are used throughout.

### Infrastructure / Ops

- **Install + N-1 upgrade smoke matrix** — CI validates fresh install and v2.23.1 → v2.23.2 upgrade across macOS Podman, macOS Docker, Linux Podman, and Linux Docker. Harness performs real install → backup → upgrade → restore → admin login verification.
- **Caddyfile contract test** — New test suite (`tests/contracts/test_caddyfile_family.py`) asserts `inject-caddy-verified` count, TLS 1.3 presence, cipher suite correctness, and `client_auth` placement on every CI run.
- **Host `/tmp` eliminated** — `install.sh`, `restore.sh`, and all CI scripts rewritten to use working-directory and `RUNNER_TEMP` paths.
- **Compose bind-mount auto-create** — `install.sh` now pre-creates bind-mount directories before starting the stack; eliminates a class of startup race on Docker rootful installs.
- **K8s Helm: `kubeconfig` to `RUNNER_TEMP`** — CI `deploy.yml` writes the kubeconfig to `RUNNER_TEMP` rather than `$HOME/.kube`, preventing credential leakage between concurrent runs.
- **`skip-pull` guard** — Installer detects when images are already present and skips the pull phase safely; prevents stale-image confusion on re-install.

### Compliance

- **OWASP ASVS v5 L3: 92% (166/180)** — Zero release-blocking FAILs. All six v2.23.1 FAILs remain closed. Per-chapter rates available at `docs/yashigani_owasp.md`.
- **OWASP API Security Top 10**: 9/10 PASS, 1/10 PARTIAL — no failures.
- **OWASP Agentic AI + LLM Top 10**: 22/25 PASS, 2/25 PARTIAL, 1/25 N/A (out-of-architecture) — no failures.

### Bug Fixes

- **Agent bundle SSRF guard wiring** — Optional agent bundles (Langflow, Letta, OpenClaw) silently failed to register on canonical install because `YASHIGANI_AGENT_UPSTREAM_HOSTNAMES` was empty and not pre-populated. The default is now `langflow,letta,openclaw` in Compose and Helm; SSRF guard code unchanged. (fix/v232-openclaw-upstream-hostnames-default)
- **str(exc) information disclosure** — `str(exc)` calls in internal result fields and error responses migrated to `safe_error_envelope` to prevent exception-class name leakage.
- **Agent-name path injection** — Regex + resolve guard prevents path traversal via crafted agent names.
- **CI workflow injection** — `env` indirection on `head_branch` + regex guard closes the GitHub Actions `workflow_run` injection vector.
- **Upgrade harness post-restore restart** — Network reconciliation bypass on post-restore restart prevents Compose from re-creating networks that already exist.
- **Postgres SSL injection** — Installer uses `podman cp` for postgres SSL cert injection when the bind-mount directory predates the certs, avoiding a startup ordering race.

---

## [v2.23.1] — 2026-05-02

Theme: **Core-Plane mTLS + Two-Tier PKI + Release Hardening**.

### Added
- Core-plane mTLS default-on across gateway, backoffice, postgres, pgbouncer, redis, opa
- Two-tier internal PKI (root → intermediate → per-service leaves) with SPIFFE-style URI SANs
- Automatic certificate issuance + rotation (admin-API + install.sh subcommands + Helm CronJob)
- Centralised SSRF allowlist helper for outbound HTTP (`yashigani.net.http_client`)
- Per-endpoint body-size limits (ASVS 4.3.1)
- Log-injection sanitisation across audit and application logs (ASVS 16.6.1)
- Algorithm allowlist on license ECDSA verifier (ES256 / SECP256R1 only)
- `/.well-known/security.txt` per RFC 9116
- Symbol-bearing generated passwords with category guarantees (`A-Za-z0-9!*,-._~`)
- AppArmor mmap permission for shared libraries (e.g. `libpython3.12.so`)

### Changed
- seccomp + AppArmor profiles default-on for all runtimes (Linux + macOS where applicable)
- Fail-closed on missing HMAC and Open WebUI secrets (no silent dev-mode fallback)
- Session rotation on password change invalidates all prior sessions (ASVS V7.4.2)
- 401 vs 404 uniformised on unauthenticated admin endpoints (no information disclosure)
- Caddy header hygiene: `Server` stripped, stale `alt-svc` removed
- TOTP enrolment split into separate provision/confirm endpoints
- Agent tier-limit returns 402 Payment Required (was 500 Internal Server Error)
- AGENT_REGISTERED events now persisted to the audit log (previously in-memory only)

### Fixed
- `YSG_RUNTIME` stale-env bleed across install invocations
- PKI trust-store mounts aligned per library compatibility (libssl-direct services use root anchor; partial-chain-capable services use intermediate; root private key never enters a workload container)

### Security
- PCI-compliant password expiry profile (≤90 days) selectable via `YASHIGANI_PASSWORD_MAX_AGE_DAYS=pci`
- Auth-throttle admin self-visibility — authenticated admins see own + all throttled/blocked IPs at `/admin → Security → Blocked IPs` (backed by `/auth/blocked-ips`). Unauthenticated locked-out operator path (RFC 6585 `Retry-After` on login) deferred to v2.23.2.
- **YSG-RISK-001 (CWE-89, HIGH)** — replaced SQL f-string interpolation in `scripts/partition_maintenance.py` with safe identifier quoting (`_quote_ident()`, allowlist `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`). Date literals in the `PARTITION OF … FOR VALUES FROM … TO …` DDL clause are formatted via `date.isoformat()` (deterministic `YYYY-MM-DD`); asyncpg / PostgreSQL do not accept bind parameters in DDL parser positions. The date values are derived from Python `date` arithmetic, never from user input. ACS v3 dogfood scan finding `acs-v3-sql-string-concat-exec`. Closing commits `75536a5` (identifier quoting) + `af114f7` (DDL date-literal exception; internal re-audit YCS-20260502-v2.23.1-CWE89-reaudit-001 PASS).
- **YSG-RISK-002 (CWE-89, MEDIUM)** — replaced `op.execute(f"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {name}")` in Alembic migration `0003_prepartition_audit_2026_2027.py` with `op.drop_table()` native API. Closing commit `9d867be`.
- **YSG-RISK-003 (CWE-601, MEDIUM)** — OIDC discovery validator now rejects `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, and `jwks_uri` whose scheme is not `https` or whose host does not match the registered `discovery_url` host. Closes the post-admin-compromise open-redirect class (TA-3 insider). Closing commit `c5839e4`.
- **YSG-RISK-004 (CWE-400, MEDIUM)** — Docker Compose `mem_limit` and `cpus` now set on every service across `docker-compose.yml` (21 services) + `docker-compose.wazuh.yml` (3 services). Defaults documented in `docker/.env.example`; env-overridable via `YASHIGANI_<SERVICE>_MEM_LIMIT` / `YASHIGANI_<SERVICE>_CPU_LIMIT`. Closing commit `0143fb4`.
- **YSG-RISK-005 (CWE-400, MEDIUM)** — Helm chart `resources.limits.{memory,cpu}` AND `resources.requests.{memory,cpu}` set on every container in the chart; surfaced as tunables in `values.yaml`. Requests = 50% of limits to satisfy the K8s scheduler. Closing commit `6c35d28`.
- **YSG-RISK-006 (CWE-668, MEDIUM)** — OpenClaw host port binding moved from `0.0.0.0:18789` to `127.0.0.1:18789`. OpenClaw remains reachable from the gateway over the internal Docker bridge by service name; the host-side binding is loopback-only. OTEL collector `0.0.0.0:*` listeners confirmed bridge-only (no host `ports:` mapping). Closing commit `33f7318`.
- **YSG-RISK-007 (CWE-918, HIGH worst-case)** — SSRF allowlists added at every flagged call site:
  - **7-A** `agents.py:218,245` — `OWUI_API_URL` validated against `YASHIGANI_OWUI_HOSTNAMES` allowlist (default `open-webui,127.0.0.1,localhost`). Commit `84aab78`.
  - **7-B** `oidc.py:160,169` — discovery URL validated against `YASHIGANI_OIDC_DISCOVERY_HOSTS` allowlist; `jwks_uri` host MUST equal `discovery_url` host (case-insensitive) and MUST be `https`; re-asserted in `_get_jwks()` as defence-in-depth. Commit `64ec325`.
  - **7-C** `audit/writer.py:285` + `backoffice/routes/audit.py:326` — Pydantic v2 `field_validator` on `SiemTargetRequest.url` enforces `https` scheme and rejects RFC 1918 / loopback / link-local / multicast hosts at register-time AND test-fire-time. `YASHIGANI_TEST_MODE=1` skips DNS resolution but keeps the HTTPS requirement. Commit `1209055`.

### Deferred (accepted-risk, carried to v2.23.2 P1)
- **YSG-RISK-008 (CWE-732/CWE-250, LOW-MEDIUM batch)** — container-hardening absent-key gaps (no `read_only: true` in compose, no `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` in Helm `securityContext`, no `security_opt: ["no-new-privileges:true"]`). Deferred (logged in risk register) with the rationale that adding YAML keys without OPA/Conftest/Kyverno admission control would be half-measure hardening; v2.23.2 ships both YAML keys AND admission policies together as proper end-to-end enforcement.

---

## [v2.22.3] — 2026-04-12

Theme: OPA on /v1, Agent Personas, Fail2ban, IP Access Control, OWASP Compliance Review.

### Added
- OPA policy enforcement on **all** `/v1/chat/completions` traffic (request + response paths, fail-closed)
- Agent personas with chaining: **Lala** (Langflow), **Julietta** (Letta), **Scout** (OpenClaw); `@Scout` → `@Julietta` → `@qwen` syntax; `@Help` chaining guide
- Fail2ban-style auth throttle: per-IP (3 failures) + global (5 failures), ×5 escalation (30s → 625m), permanent IP block after maximum
- IP allowlist + blocklist (IPv4 / IPv6 / CIDR, admin manageable; blocklist precedence)
- Content relay detection (agent-to-agent content laundering)
- Crypto inventory API (`/admin/crypto/inventory`) + admin UI with JSON export
- `__Host-` cookie prefix on session cookies (enforces Secure, Path=/, no Domain)
- Self-service password reset (TOTP-verified, no admin involvement)
- Wazuh SIEM full stack (`--wazuh`): manager + indexer + dashboard
- Grafana + Prometheus admin access at `/admin/grafana/` and `/admin/prometheus/` via Caddy forward_auth
- Monitoring tab in admin UI (Grafana / Prometheus / Wazuh links)
- OWASP compliance review (ASVS v5 all 17 chapters + API Security + Agentic AI / LLM Top 10) with per-control PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL / N/A verdicts and file:line evidence
- Risk register (5×5 quantitative-analysis matrix)
- Audit log viewer (search, filter, CSV export)
- Dashboard auto-refresh (15s), session-timeout warning (10 min), first-run onboarding checklist
- Podman SDK (`podman-py`) for container-per-user isolation

### Changed
- PKCE on all OIDC flows (`code_verifier` / `code_challenge`)
- `acr` / `amr` validation on ID tokens (auth-strength enforcement)
- Constant-time TOTP comparison (`hmac.compare_digest`)
- Context-specific password word list (blocks "yashigani", "admin", "password", etc.)
- Postgres migrations now run on startup (`pg_partman` / `pg_cron` optional)

### Removed
- **Goose** agent (ACP integration too slow on CPU; replaced by Letta/Julietta)

### Security
- Login branding (Agnostic Security footer)

## [v2.22.0] – [v2.22.2] — 2026-04-12

Patch sequence completing the v2.22.x feature set listed under v2.22.3.

---

## [v2.20] (untagged release line, 2026-04 series)

Theme: Security Hardening, PII Detection, and Compliance.

### Added
- License anti-tampering (v4 counter-signature schema; binary-patch-detecting self-integrity check at startup)
- PII detection module (`yashigani.pii`) — 10 entity types (SSN, credit card with Luhn validation, email, phone, IBAN, passport, NHS number, driver's licence, IP address, date of birth) — three modes: LOG / REDACT / BLOCK — bidirectional (request + response paths) — cloud bypass requires explicit admin opt-in
- Response-path inspection wired to all `/v1/*` routes (`ResponseInspectionPipeline` activation)
- WAF and DDoS protection: hardened Caddy timeouts and body limits + per-IP `DDoSProtector` (Redis-backed, 429 + `Retry-After`); `Caddyfile.waf` reference for Coraza WAF plugin
- Streaming chunk-level inspection (`StreamingInspector`) for `/v1/*` SSE responses
- HMAC-SHA256 per-tenant email hashing in SSO audit events (closes cross-tenant correlation risk)
- Ollama model digest pinning (validates SHA-256 on subsequent starts; alerts on mismatch)
- Open WebUI "Powered by Open WebUI" attribution (commercial-use compliance)
- 9-framework compliance mapping document; 2 STRIDE threat models (product: 17 threats; solution: 38 threats)
- Helm chart fixes (`helm lint` clean) + Kubernetes network policies covering all v2.0 / v2.1 services

### Changed
- Container hardening: explicit `security_opt`, `cap_drop`, `read_only` directives in compose; embedded seccomp profile at `docker/seccomp/yashigani.json`
- FastText classifier model baked into Docker image (no outbound dependency for inspection at startup)
- Model aliases: write-through to Redis on every CRUD operation; Redis read path with Postgres source-of-truth

### Security
- SBOM (CycloneDX 1.5) per image
- Cosign keyless image signing (Sigstore, GitHub Actions OIDC)
- 548 tests (523 unit + 25 e2e)

---

## [v2.1.0] — 2026-04-02

Theme: Admin Dashboard + Alerting + SSO + Persistence.

### Added
- Admin Dashboard UI (login page + 9-section admin panel)
- 12 Alertmanager rules covering P1-P5 severity for routing and budget conditions
- Budget Postgres persistence (counters survive container restarts and Redis eviction)
- Pool Manager background health monitor (daemon thread)
- OIDC identity broker — full end-to-end (`handle_oidc_callback()`, JWKS discovery, group extraction for Entra ID / Okta / Cognito / Keycloak)
- Mandatory 2FA after SSO (TOTP required even after IdP success)
- Keycloak test IdP (`test-idp` compose profile with three users: alice, bob, carol)

### Changed
- SSO email hashing standardised (SHA-256, raw email never stored)
- CSRF protection on OIDC flows via Redis-backed state/nonce tokens (10-minute TTL, ASVS V3.5.3)
- Podman rootless parity: corrected user namespace; `keep-id` removed from root-running services; e2e auto-detects runtime

### Security
- 413 tests (388 unit + 25 e2e)

---

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-04-02

Theme: First production-grade release. Five major subsystems transform Yashigani into a complete AI operations platform.

### Added
- **Unified Identity Model** — every entity (human or service) is a single identity record with a `kind` field; same governance, RBAC, budget, and audit for all kinds
- **Optimization Engine** — four-dimensional routing (sensitivity + complexity + budget + cost) with P1-P9 priority matrix; CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED data always stays local (immutable)
- **Three-Tier Budget System** — org cloud cap → group → individual; budget-redis (noeviction policy); `X-Yashigani-Budget-*` response headers
- **Open WebUI Integration** — chat interface at `/chat/*` (internal Docker network only); all LLM calls route through gateway; Open WebUI holds zero LLM credentials
- **Container Pool Manager** — per-identity container isolation with universal lifecycle (create / route / health / replace / scale / postmortem); self-healing (replace, don't fix); forensic preservation before kill
- **Multi-IdP Identity Broker** — OIDC + SAML v2 native; Caddy delegates auth to backoffice; SCIM provisions users and groups
- **Sensitivity Classification Pipeline** — three layers ON by default: regex + FastText (sub-5ms offline) + Ollama (qwen2.5)
- **OPA Routing Safety Net** — second OPA pass on every routing decision; local-LLM policy validation with SAFE / WARNING / BLOCK verdicts
- **P1-P5 Alert Severity** — sensitivity breach (P1), OPA override (P1), classification conflict (P2), spending anomaly (P2), budget auto-switch (P3); SIEM integration for all
- 12 Grafana dashboards (9 existing + 3 new: budget, Optimization Engine, Pool Manager)

### Changed
- Open WebUI auth delegation via Caddy `WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_EMAIL_HEADER`
- License tier container limits introduced

### Security
- 363 tests (252 original + 111 new)

---
