# Yashigani v2.23.2 — enable TLS + client-cert verification on Postgres.
# Last updated: 2026-04-27T20:40:49Z (BUG-59-01: trust intermediate CA, not root)
#
# This init script runs ONCE on first initdb of the postgres container (the
# stock postgres entrypoint executes /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.sh in
# alphabetical order before starting the server for real).
#
# After this script:
#   * ssl = on in postgresql.conf
#   * Server presents its own leaf cert (./secrets/postgres_client.crt) to
#     connecting clients
#   * Clients must present a cert signed by our internal CA
#     (clientcert=verify-ca)
#   * Password auth (scram-sha-256) still required on top of the cert
#     (defence in depth — three factors: TLS + cert + password)
#
# PKI design: root → intermediate → leaf (two-tier).
# ssl_ca_file (root.crt) must contain the INTERMEDIATE CA, not the root.
# All service leaf certs are signed directly by the intermediate.  When
# pgbouncer presents its client cert to postgres it may not send the
# intermediate in the TLS handshake chain (behaviour varies by libssl
# version / pgbouncer version).  Seeding root.crt with the intermediate
# ensures postgres can always verify the leaf directly without requiring the
# intermediate to appear in the peer's TLS Certificate message.
#
# The root CA MUST NOT appear in this file and MUST NOT be mounted as an
# mTLS trust anchor into any workload container (design invariant, retro S1).
