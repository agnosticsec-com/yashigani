# Yashigani v2.24.0 — pgbouncer auth_query postgres-side setup.
# Last updated: 2026-05-25 (fix: YSG-RISK-073 cycle 7 — cert auth + pg_ident CN map)
#
# YSG-RISK-049 architectural close — ref:
#   internal-docs/yashigani/iris-v240-pgbouncer-auth-query-design.md
#   internal-docs/yashigani/laura-v240-pgbouncer-auth-query-threat-model.md

# YSG-RISK-073 cycle 7 closed — cert auth + pg_ident; YSG-RISK-077 (platform SCRAM bug).
#
# Runs ONCE on first initdb (postgres entrypoint executes
# /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.sh alphabetically before starting the server).
# Numbered 10-* so it runs after 05-enable-ssl.sh which writes pg_hba.conf.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: safe to re-run on an existing cluster (IF NOT EXISTS / OR REPLACE
# guards throughout). For v2.23.4→v2.24.0 upgrades, the operator runs this
# script once via:
#   docker exec yashigani-postgres psql -U "${POSTGRES_USER:-yashigani_app}" -d yashigani \
#     -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/10-pgbouncer-auth.sh
# before starting the updated pgbouncer containers.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. Creates pgbouncer_authenticator role (LOGIN, NOSUPERUSER, NO PASSWORD).
#      Cycle 7: no password — cert auth replaces SCRAM for auth_user connection.
#   2. Creates SECURITY DEFINER function ysg_pgbouncer_get_auth in yashigani DB.
#   3. REVOKE EXECUTE from PUBLIC, GRANT EXECUTE to pgbouncer_authenticator only.
#   4. REVOKE CONNECT on databases that pgbouncer_authenticator must not access.
#   5. Writes pg_ident.conf CN mapping (pgb-auth-map).
#   6. Inserts cert auth pg_hba carveout for pgbouncer_authenticator (YSG-RISK-073 cycle 7).

# ─── 1. Create pgbouncer_authenticator role ──────────────────────────────────
# NOSUPERUSER, NOCREATEDB, NOCREATEROLE, NOREPLICATION, NOINHERIT.
# Grants: LOGIN + CONNECT to yashigani only + EXECUTE on ysg_pgbouncer_get_auth.
# No table grants, no schema grants, no access to letta or postgres databases.
#
# NOTE on pg_hba auth method (YSG-RISK-073 cycle 7 — cert + pg_ident):
# The pg_hba carveout uses `cert map=pgb-auth-map`. Single-factor cert auth:
# - cert method: pg16 requires verify-full (CN verified against pg_ident map).
# - pg_ident map pgb-auth-map:
#     pgbouncer-auth    → pgbouncer_authenticator  (main pgbouncer instance)
#     letta-pgbouncer   → pgbouncer_authenticator  (letta sidecar pgbouncer)
# - NO PASSWORD required: cert is the sole credential.
#
# WHY NOT scram-sha-256 (cycle 6 approach — broken on Mac/Podman / YSG-RISK-077):
# pgbouncer 1.25.1 (edoburu, ARM64) has a SCRAM client-side computation bug.
# It computes incorrect SCRAM proofs when authenticating outbound as auth_user
# on ARM64 Linux (including Mac Podman's ARM64 container runtime). The bug was
# confirmed on Mac/Podman (cycle 7 failure) and the cycle 6 "live test PASS" was
# run on the Linux VM only — same pgbouncer binary, different Podman network stack.
# Platform SCRAM root cause documented in YSG-RISK-077.
#
# WHY cert + pg_ident is SECURE (not a downgrade from SCRAM):
# - cert method implies verify-full: full chain + CN verified (stronger than
#   the old trust+clientcert=verify-ca which was only verify-ca).
# - pg_ident mapping restricts to CN=pgbouncer-auth AND CN=letta-pgbouncer ONLY.
#   Any other cert (even CA-signed) cannot authenticate as pgbouncer_authenticator.
# - YSG-RISK-075 (Laura cycle 5): lateral-pivot attack via trust+clientcert allowed
#   ANY CA-cert holder to impersonate pgbouncer_authenticator (11 certs on data net).
#   cert+pg_ident closes this: only the two named CNs are mapped. All other data-
#   network services hold certs with different CNs — none can impersonate.
# - pgbouncer-auth cert: mounted EXCLUSIVELY to pgbouncer containers.
# - letta-pgbouncer cert: mounted EXCLUSIVELY to letta-pgbouncer container.
# - An attacker needs the private key for one of these two specific certs,
#   which requires compromising THOSE specific containers (not just any data net service).
#
# NO PASSWORD = no pgbouncer_authenticator_password secret needed:
# The role has no password. LOGIN without password is valid for cert auth.
# install.sh still generates pgbouncer_authenticator_password for backwards compat
# but it is no longer mounted into postgres and no longer used for auth_user.
# (pgbouncer command wrapper simplified — DATABASE_URL no longer needs the password.)

# ─── 4. pg_ident.conf CN map + cert pg_hba carveout (YSG-RISK-073 cycle 7) ──
# BUG-NEW-001 / YSG-RISK-073: History of the pgbouncer_authenticator pg_hba carveout.
#
# CYCLE 7 FIX: cert auth via pg_ident CN mapping (YSG-RISK-077 root cause).
#
# ROOT CAUSE (YSG-RISK-077): pgbouncer 1.25.1 (edoburu, ARM64) has a SCRAM
# client-side computation bug on ARM64 Linux. It sends incorrect SCRAM proofs
# when authenticating outbound as auth_user. This affects Mac/Podman (ARM64
# container runtime). Cycle 6 "live test PASS" was Linux VM only (same binary,
# different host). Confirmed via verbose pgbouncer debug logging + Python
# SCRAM proof verification (testing_runs/captain_bug_c7_001_scram_fix_20260525/).
#
# FIX: cert auth method + pg_ident.conf CN mapping.
# - pg_ident map (pgb-auth-map) maps two CNs to pgbouncer_authenticator:
#     pgbouncer-auth    → pgbouncer_authenticator  (main pgbouncer)
#     letta-pgbouncer   → pgbouncer_authenticator  (letta-pgbouncer sidecar)
# - cert method: PG16 cert auth implies verify-full (full chain + CN verified).
# - NO PASSWORD: pgbouncer presents its TLS client cert; no SCRAM exchange.
# - pgbouncer_authenticator role has no password (PASSWORD NULL).
#
# SECURITY vs TRUST+CLIENTCERT (Laura cycle 5 finding — YSG-RISK-075):
# - cycle 5 trust+clientcert=verify-ca: ANY CA-cert holder can impersonate
#   pgbouncer_authenticator (11 certs on data network; one compromise = full DB).
#   Laura confirmed attack chain. Unacceptable.
# - cycle 7 cert+pg_ident: ONLY certs with CN=pgbouncer-auth OR CN=letta-pgbouncer
#   map to pgbouncer_authenticator. All other certs (11 on data net) have different
#   CNs and cannot impersonate. YSG-RISK-075 lateral-pivot CLOSED.
#
# SECURITY vs SCRAM+CLIENTCERT (cycle 6 — broken on Mac/Podman):
# - cycle 6 scram-sha-256+clientcert=verify-ca: two-factor (cert + password).
#   verify-ca only (chain verified, CN not checked).
# - cycle 7 cert+pg_ident: cert method = verify-full (chain + CN checked).
#   CN mapped to specific role via pg_ident (CN-specific restriction).
#   Net security: STRONGER CN binding + platform-independent (no SCRAM bug).
#
# CERT AUTH + pg_ident HISTORY:
#   v2.24.3 cycle 3/4: `cert clientcert=verify-ca` — WRONG syntax.
#     PG16 rejects: cert method requires verify-full, not verify-ca.
#     AND: no pg_ident map; CN=pgbouncer-auth != role pgbouncer_authenticator.
#   v2.24.3 cycle 7: `cert map=pgb-auth-map` — CORRECT.
#     cert method implies verify-full (no clientcert= needed, it's implicit).
#     pg_ident maps CN → role (no CN==role-name requirement).
#     Tested live on Mac/Podman: PASS. Postgres log:
#       connection authenticated: identity="CN=pgbouncer-auth,O=Agnostic Security"
#                                  method=cert (/pg_hba.conf:N)
#
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: this script is the ONLY writer of the
# pgbouncer_authenticator carveout AND pg_ident entries. 05-enable-ssl.sh
# does NOT write these (removed in BUG-C4-002 fix). Prevents duplicate entries.
#
# Idempotent: removes stale pg_hba lines, rewrites pg_ident.conf map entries,
# inserts cert carveout. Handles:
#   - Fresh initdb.
#   - Upgrade from v2.24.0-v2.24.2 (no carveout).
#   - Upgrade from v2.24.3 cycle 3/4 (cert+verify-ca — broken).
