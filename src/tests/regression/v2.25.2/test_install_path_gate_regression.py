"""
Regression gate: v2.25.2 install-path fixes (found by the §4.5 clean-slate validation).

Each of these guarded a real install bug that had ZERO automated coverage — they would
silently regress without this gate. Static guards over install.sh / the wazuh overlay:
cheap, local, no infra. The behavioural counterpart is scripts/test_install_clean_slate.sh.

Fix references:
  - digest-strip drops overlays  (wazuh-security-init never created → SIEM chain stalls)
  - wazuh-mtls re-run idempotency (prior run chowns the dir to the container UID)
  - contaminated-volume check project-aware (COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME; seeds 2.26 multi-instance)
  - convergence gate too tight    (full fresh install needs >180s to converge while healthy)
  - wazuh overlay is a clean DELTA (no duplicate security_opt → no merge break) + has the
    security-init sidecar + the indexer-cert SAN guard.

v2.25.2 / clean-slate validation — 2026-06-01.
