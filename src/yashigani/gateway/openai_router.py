"""
Yashigani Gateway — OpenAI-compatible API router (/v1/*).

Provides /v1/chat/completions and /v1/models endpoints that Open WebUI
and other OpenAI-compatible clients can use. All requests go through the
full Yashigani pipeline: identity resolution, sensitivity scan, complexity
scoring, budget enforcement, OE routing, PII filtering, and audit.

v2.23.2 (F-T10-001): Overreliance UX controls.
  Every LLM response now carries:
  - ``X-Yashigani-Generated-Content: true`` — informs operator UIs that the
    response body is AI-generated content, enabling badge/disclaimer rendering.
  - ``X-Yashigani-Response-Inspection-Confidence`` — float [0.0–1.0]; the
    response-inspection pipeline confidence score.  "1.0" when inspection is
    disabled or skipped (clean-pass default).  Operator UIs render a low-
    confidence badge when this value is below the configured threshold.
  - ``X-Yashigani-Low-Confidence-Stepup: required`` — emitted when the
    response-inspection confidence falls below YASHIGANI_LOW_CONFIDENCE_STEPUP_THRESHOLD
    (default 0.50) **and** the sensitivity level is CONFIDENTIAL or RESTRICTED.
    The operator UI intercept is expected to surface a "verify before acting"
    prompt.  This closes OWASP Agentic AI T10 (Overreliance) gap F-T10-001.

  ASVS mapping: V13.2.6 (LLM output handling); OWASP Agentic AI T10 Overreliance.

v1.0: Buffered responses only (Decision 13). Full response collected
before delivery to enable response inspection and token counting.

v2.2: Streaming support added. When ``body.stream == True`` and
``YASHIGANI_STREAMING_ENABLED=true`` (default), requests are forwarded
to Ollama with ``stream=true`` and responses are yielded as SSE chunks
via FastAPI ``StreamingResponse``.

v2.2: PII detection wired into both the request path (before forwarding)
and the response path (before delivery). PII filtering is ON by default
for all traffic — local and cloud. Cloud bypass is OFF by default; admins
must explicitly enable it via the admin panel.

Streaming limitations
---------------------
- Budget headers (``X-Yashigani-Budget-*``) are NOT sent on streaming
  responses. HTTP headers must be committed before the body starts; token
  counts are only available from the final Ollama chunk. Budget accounting
  is still recorded internally — clients that need budget state should poll
  the budget API or use a non-streaming request.
- Agent routing (``@agent`` model prefix) always uses the buffered path
  regardless of the ``stream`` flag, because agent upstreams may not
  support SSE.
- PII mode=log: streaming responses are allowed (request-path PII only).
  PII mode=block|redact: streaming is force-disabled to enable full
  response-path inspection. This adds ~2-3s latency but ensures PII
  cannot leak through streamed responses.

# Problem: when @letta is the orchestrating brain, its OWN reasoning *about* a
# security task ("test the boundaries / threat-model / cloud 9") trips the
# response classifier (0.95–1.0) → the response-leg OPA gate 403s → the loop
# finalizes gracefully and the requested threat-model cognition is SUPPRESSED.
# But the brain→LLM (A→L) leg is the orchestrator's OWN cognition — it is
# consumed ONLY by the gateway loop to pick the next GATED hop, never delivered
# to a human and never used as a tool result.  We therefore "evaluate-not-
# suppress" that ONE leg: compute the verdict + OPA decision and AUDIT them
# (relaxation_applied=true), but relax only the 403/substitute ACTION.
#
# THE MARKER IS NOT A HEADER.  letta calls the gateway's LLM endpoint
# autonomously via OPENAI_API_BASE with a static internal bearer + static model;
# it adds no per-request headers and cannot be trusted to.  So the marker is
# PROCESS-LOCAL gateway state: the executor brackets each brain round-trip
# (`_letta_send`) with begin()/end() on a counter held in THIS module.  letta
# cannot read, set, clear, or forge that counter — it is not derived from model
# name, content, or any letta-controllable input.  The inbound LLM call that
# arrives WHILE a brain round-trip is open, from the internal-bearer identity,
# on the brain model, IS the brain-reasoning leg.
#
# CONCURRENCY / MISLABEL SAFETY: a concurrent NON-brain letta chat whose LLM
# call happens to overlap an open brain round-trip could be mislabelled as a
# reasoning leg and have its 403-action relaxed.  This is NOT exploitable: the
# load-bearing leak guard (condition 4) routes ANY relaxed completion that
# parses to a final/prose answer back through the STANDARD (non-relaxed) egress
# gate before it can reach a human.  A relaxed completion may only ever resolve
# to a `call_tool` decision re-entering the full gate.  Mislabelling can at most
# let an INTERNAL reasoning turn through to the brain loop — never to a user.

    ``stream:true``.  When OPA policies are active (always, in real deployments)
    or PII block/redact is on, the gateway force-disables streaming and buffers
    the full response for inspection — but it must still answer a ``stream:true``

    OpenAI semantics: a stream:true request ALWAYS returns SSE, even if the body
    was produced via a single buffered upstream call.  To match the canonical
    OpenAI streaming framing that browser SSE clients (incl. Open WebUI) expect,
    we emit THREE ``chat.completion.chunk`` frames:

    avoids frontend SSE parsers that reject a role+content+finish_reason combined

    Query OPA v1_routing response_decision for allow/deny on response delivery.

    Checks whether the caller's sensitivity ceiling permits receiving
    content at the detected sensitivity level.

    v2.24.1 — GAP-3 / SEC-5:
        `response_sensitivity` is the response-CONTENT sensitivity (from the
        ResponseInspectionPipeline).  It may be None when the pipeline is
        disabled (default per YSG-RISK-057).
        `prompt_sensitivity` is the REQUEST (prompt) sensitivity from step 3.
        OPA receives both; v1_routing.rego evaluates MAX(prompt, response)
        — the stricter of the two.
        When response_sensitivity is None (pipeline off), it is omitted from
        the OPA input document, and the Rego rule falls back to prompt-only
        check (backward-compatible with pre-v2.24.1 callers).

    Zero-trust fail-closed behaviour (ASVS V8.* + V14.5.*):

    When OPA responds with allow: False  → audit event written, request denied.
    When OPA is unreachable / errors     → audit event written, REQUEST DENIED
                                           (fail-closed), Prometheus counter

                                           delivery outage (intentional).
    When OPA is not configured           → REQUEST DENIED (fail-closed) unless

      An OPA outage causes response-delivery denials until OPA recovers.

      feedback_zero_trust_default.md.  Do not bypass — fix OPA instead.
