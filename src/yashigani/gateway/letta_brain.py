"""
Yashigani Gateway — letta-as-orchestrating-brain (Design A, build sheet §4.2).

PHASE 2.  The user names ``@letta`` as the orchestrator.  Per the build-sheet
security thesis (§4.1) the gateway is ALWAYS the executor: letta is the reasoning
brain (it keeps its memory / planning), but it has NO network route to upstreams
(verified UA-10 bridge isolation: letta sits on ``letta_isolated`` only; the
gateway is the single common node — letta cannot reach langflow / demo-mcp).  The
ONLY path from letta to any callee is back through the gateway.

THE BINDING MECHANISM (Design A as built — "gateway-mediated letta brain"):

  • The orchestration ReAct loop in ``orchestrator.run_orchestration`` is reused
    verbatim.  Only the BRAIN call is swapped: instead of asking qwen2.5:3b for
    the next tool step (Phase-1 ``_call_orchestrator``), the loop asks LETTA via
    ``call_letta_brain``.  Letta receives the original user turn + the gateway's
    RBAC-projected tool catalog + any prior (quarantine-wrapped) tool results, and
    returns its next decision: either a tool call or a final answer.

  • EVERY tool letta names is executed by the SAME ``_execute_tool_call`` gated
    path as Phase 1 — OPA ingress + OPA egress + ResponseInspection + quarantine
    framing + provenance cap + exfil-via-args guard + depth counting.  Letta's
    tool calls therefore flow through the IDENTICAL gated executor; there is no
    second, un-gated path (§0.1 invariant holds identically for letta's hops).

  • Letta's OWN reasoning runs on qwen2.5:3b *through the gateway*
    (``OPENAI_API_BASE=http://gateway:8081/v1`` in the letta container) — so the
    letta→LLM hop is itself an OPA-adjudicated A→L edge, ingress+egress, exactly
    like any other gateway-mediated LLM call.  Nothing letta does escapes the gate.

WHY ELICITATION, NOT NATIVE LETTA TOOL-CALLING (R-ORCH-3 surface reduction).
The build sheet (§1.4, §4.2) flags letta's native tool-call shape as
non-deterministic and a NEW trust edge.  Rather than register N gateway-proxy
tools inside letta (more wiring, a bigger attack surface, and letta would need an
MCP/tool client that could in principle hold its own egress), we keep letta's tool
surface EMPTY and elicit its decision through a structured-JSON protocol on the
letta message API.  Letta plans in natural language + emits a single JSON tool
decision; the gateway parses it and runs the hop through its own gated executor.
This honours "letta is the brain" (its memory + planning drive the orchestration)
while keeping the letta↔gateway edge a single authenticated, parse-validated
channel — the smallest secure surface for Design A.

THE LETTA↔GATEWAY TRUST EDGE (R-ORCH-3) is authenticated by the internal bearer
on the loopback self-calls the executor makes, and letta reaches the gateway only
as an LLM client (its OPENAI_API_BASE).  Letta never receives the internal bearer
and never initiates a privileged call; it only ever RESPONDS to the gateway's
brain prompt.  The gateway, not letta, holds the authority to execute tools.
