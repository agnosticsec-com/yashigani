"""
SPIFFE URI ACL gate — application-layer identity check for service-to-service
callers.

Last updated: 2026-04-30T04:30:00+01:00

Threat model and trust boundary
-------------------------------
Every request arriving at /internal/metrics (and future gated endpoints) passes
through Caddy, our internal TLS edge and CA. Caddy validates the peer's client
certificate against the internal CA and forwards the first URI SAN of the
verified peer cert as the ``X-SPIFFE-ID`` header. Caddy strips any inbound
occurrence of that header before setting its own — a co-tenant on the internal
bridge network cannot forge the value.

Python's trust in the header depends on the transport hop that delivered it:
the upstream connection from Caddy to gateway/backoffice is already on
core-plane mTLS (see internal-mtls Caddyfile snippet and Uvicorn's
``ssl_cert_reqs=CERT_REQUIRED``). Any request on that listener that claims a
SPIFFE ID therefore came via Caddy. We do NOT honour ``X-SPIFFE-ID`` on
public-facing paths — this module is only attached to internal endpoints.

Contract
--------
``require_spiffe_id(path)`` returns a FastAPI dependency that:

  * 401 if the header is missing (``no_spiffe_id``)
  * 403 if the ACL table has no entry for this path (``no_acl_for_path``)
  * 403 if the header value is not in the allowlist (``spiffe_id_not_allowed``)
  * 200-passthrough (returns the caller SPIFFE ID) on success

The ACL source is the same ``service_identities.yaml`` manifest used by the
PKI issuer. This keeps the allowlist in one place: the file that also mints
the cert that carries the URI SAN, reviewed under git.

Fail-closed semantics
---------------------
If the manifest is missing or unreadable at initial load, the ACL cache is an
empty dict — every gated path returns 403.  There is no silent open mode.

On TTL-triggered refresh, a parse or I/O failure retains the **previous** good
cache (retain-on-parse-failure). This prevents a transient manifest edit or
mid-write file state from turning into an outage.  The failure is logged at
CRITICAL so operators are alerted without a service interruption.

Cache + TTL
-----------
The manifest is loaded lazily on the first gate call. After loading it is
cached for ``YASHIGANI_SPIFFE_ACL_TTL_SECONDS`` seconds (default 60). On
every gate call the cached age is checked; if stale, a reload is attempted.
SVID revocation therefore propagates within one TTL window — satisfying ASVS
v5 V8.3.3 (permission propagation across services within defined TTL).
