EX-231-10 Layer B — Caddy HMAC shared-secret verifier.

Last updated: 2026-04-29T17:45:00+01:00

Layer A (EX-231-09, network isolation) ensures only Caddy can reach
backoffice:8443 and gateway:8080 at the Docker-network layer. Layer B adds a
cryptographic marker that closes the residual: a container on caddy_internal
that already holds a valid mTLS cert (e.g. prometheus_client cert) and forges
X-SPIFFE-ID can still reach internal endpoints. Without Layer B this yields
HTTP 200. With Layer B active it yields 401 because the attacker cannot know
the per-install ``caddy_internal_hmac`` secret.

Design (static-shared-secret variant — Caddy 2 has no inline HMAC module):
- ``install.sh`` generates ``caddy_internal_hmac`` (32-byte hex, 64 chars).
- Caddy reads ``CADDY_INTERNAL_HMAC`` env var and injects the raw value as
  ``X-Caddy-Verified-Secret`` on every ``reverse_proxy`` to backoffice/gateway.
  Caddy also strips any inbound ``X-Caddy-Verified-Secret`` (snippet
  ``inject-caddy-verified`` in Caddyfile.selfsigned and Caddyfile.acme).
  IMPORTANT: the Caddyfile uses ``{$CADDY_INTERNAL_HMAC}`` (parse-time env
  substitution) NOT ``{env.CADDY_INTERNAL_HMAC}`` (request-time placeholder
  that is NOT resolved in header_up directives). This distinction was the root
  cause of the Round 1 failure (2026-04-29).
- ``load_caddy_secret()`` is called at lifespan startup of both backoffice and
  gateway.  If the secret cannot be loaded, a ``RuntimeError`` is raised and
  the container refuses to start (fail-closed per CLAUDE.md §3).
- ``CaddyVerifiedMiddleware`` runs on every request.  It allows:
  - ``/healthz`` (gateway) and ``/admin/healthz`` (backoffice) and ``/readyz``
    unconditionally (inside-pod healthcheck exec hits localhost directly, not
    via Caddy, so it carries no header).
  - Everything else → checks ``X-Caddy-Verified-Secret`` with
    ``hmac.compare_digest``.  Absent or mismatched → 401 JSON response.
  - If ``_caddy_secret`` is ``None`` at middleware evaluation time (lifespan
    startup silently failed) → 401, never pass-through.

Security note (replay):
Replay is accepted as residual risk (DevOps evidence doc da3dc08, §HMAC
Pattern).  The secret only flows over caddy_internal — the mTLS-protected
bridge. An attacker able to sniff this network has already broken mTLS, which
is a more severe finding.  The secret is rotated on every ``install.sh
--upgrade`` restart.

Closes: EX-231-10 Layer B (Engineering dispatch 2026-04-29, Round 2).
