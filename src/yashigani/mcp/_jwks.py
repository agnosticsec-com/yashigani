"""
MCP Broker — JWKS endpoint response builder.

Per Nico spec §5:
  - Endpoint: GET /.well-known/yashigani-mcp-jwks.json
  - Cache-Control: max-age=300, must-revalidate
  - No auth required (public endpoint).
  - Must be served over TLS.
  - During rotation overlap: both old and new keys included atomically.

Key rotation overlap:
  After a key rotation event, both old and new keys are in the JWKS response.
  The old key is retired after max_jwt_ttl + skew_tolerance = 65 seconds.
  Swap is atomic (read-copy-update via _active_jwks reference replacement).

v2.25.0 / P1 W3 Phase 2b-ii / Nico spec §5.

# Nico fix (ship-blocker): cache-window alignment.
#
# _jwt.py JWT TTL = 60s.  Key retire window (retire_old called after JWT TTL
# + skew = 65s).  If clients cache the JWKS for 300s, there is a ~234s window
# after a rotation where clients may hold a stale JWKS entry that no longer
# contains the new key — leading to verification failures.
#
# Fix: set max-age to 60 (== JWT TTL) so clients re-fetch the JWKS at least
# once per JWT lifetime.  This ensures any client will see the new key before
# the old key is retired.
#
# The previous value of 300 came from Nico spec §5 "short TTL for rapid rotation"
# but was inconsistent with the actual retire window.  60s is the correct value
# that closes the gap without changing the retire window itself.
