"""v2.23.3 — Persistent encrypted auth settings (admin-panel HIBP API key).

Revision ID: 0007
Revises: 0006
Create Date: 2026-05-07

Rationale:
    Operators who use the commercial-tier rate-limit lift on the HIBP
    Passwords API, or who run a self-hosted HIBP mirror requiring auth,
    need a way to set/rotate the HIBP API key from the admin panel without
    touching .env files or restarting containers. This migration creates the
    durable backing store for that and any future small auth-config values.

Table:
    auth_settings — key/value store for operator-configurable auth settings.
    Each row's value is encrypted at rest using pgp_sym_encrypt so the
    app AES key (injected per transaction via app.aes_key) is required to
    decrypt. Single row per setting key; upsert-on-conflict is used for writes.

Initial setting keys:
    hibp_api_key — HIBP API key for rate-limit lift or mirror auth.
                   Empty string means "not configured" (fall back to env var
                   or anonymous request). Empty string is still encrypted.

-- The AuthSettingsStore.get_setting() / set_setting() methods handle the
-- missing-row case gracefully: a missing row is treated as empty string.
-- The application creates the row on first write (upsert-on-conflict).
