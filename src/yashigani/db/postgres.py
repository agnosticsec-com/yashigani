"""
Postgres connection pool via asyncpg + PgBouncer.

Design:
- Single asyncpg pool per process, shared across all coroutines.
- PgBouncer is the actual Postgres connection manager (transaction mode).
  asyncpg connects to PgBouncer (port 5432), not Postgres directly.
- app.tenant_id and app.aes_key are SET at the start of every transaction.
  This is safe in PgBouncer transaction mode because the SET is within the
  transaction boundary.
- All queries use asyncpg's $1/$2 parameterized syntax. No f-strings in SQL.

AES-GCM nonce / IV uniqueness guarantee (ASVS 11.3.4):
  All column-level encryption uses PostgreSQL's pgcrypto extension via
  pgp_sym_encrypt(). pgcrypto generates a unique random IV for every call
  using OpenSSL's CSPRNG — this is a PostgreSQL guarantee documented in the
  pgcrypto source (src/contrib/pgcrypto/pgp-encrypt.c: pgp_create_pkt_writer
  calls px_get_random_bytes for each session key packet).
  There is no application-level AES-GCM cipher usage outside pgcrypto;
  all symmetric encryption is delegated to pgp_sym_encrypt/pgp_sym_decrypt.
  No manual nonce management is required or performed.

Restart resilience (RETRO-R4-2):
  asyncpg pools drop broken connections automatically: when postgres restarts,
  the next acquire() call on a stale connection raises
  asyncpg.exceptions.PostgresConnectionError (or TLSError during the mTLS
  handshake). asyncpg.Pool swallows the broken connection and opens a fresh
  one. The application does NOT need explicit reconnect logic for normal
  query paths.

  The advisory-lock path (psycopg2, bootstrap/migration) is different:
  psycopg2.connect() has no default connect timeout and hangs indefinitely
  when postgres is mid-restart. We set connect_timeout=30 on that connection
  (see app.py) via a dedicated helper: connect_with_retry_sync().

    Connect to postgres synchronously (psycopg2) with retry + connect_timeout.

    RETRO-R4-2: the advisory lock path (run_migrations + bootstrap in app.py)
    uses a bare psycopg2 connection that previously had no connect timeout.
    When postgres restarts mid-lifespan, psycopg2.connect() hangs indefinitely
    (TCP SYN_SENT with no server to accept). Fix:
      - Add connect_timeout=N (passed as a DSN parameter, or via dsn_params).
      - Retry with exponential backoff for up to max_attempts if the connection
        fails with OperationalError (connection refused, server starting up).
      - Raise after max_attempts so the lifespan fails loudly rather than
        hanging the process.
