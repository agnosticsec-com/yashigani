Captain: Dockerfile COPY path validation against build.context.

Regression guard for the bug introduced in commit c838004 where
docker/caddy/Dockerfile.caddy contained:

    COPY caddy/caddy-entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/caddy-entrypoint.sh

but docker-compose.yml sets build.context: .. (repo root, one level above
docker/). The COPY path resolves relative to the build context, so the
correct path is:

    COPY docker/caddy/caddy-entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/caddy-entrypoint.sh

This file was absent at <repo-root>/caddy/caddy-entrypoint.sh, causing all
Podman builds to fail with "no such file or directory" at the COPY step.

These tests assert:
  1. Every COPY source path in docker/caddy/Dockerfile.caddy resolves to a
     real file when interpreted relative to the build.context (repo root).
  2. The entrypoint source path specifically uses docker/caddy/ prefix.
  3. The docker-compose.yml caddy service build.context is repo root (..).
  4. The Dockerfile used by compose matches docker/caddy/Dockerfile.caddy.

If any test here fails, the Caddy image CANNOT be built — install is blocked
on all Podman platforms (Mac and Linux/VM). This is a SHIP-BLOCKER class bug.
