"""
Agent OPENAI_API_BASE port contract (BUG-V241-LANGFLOW-LETTA-BASE-URL regression gate).

Static contract: asserts that every agent bundle that calls back to the gateway
(langflow, letta, openclaw) routes through the plain-HTTP mesh port (8081), NOT
the mTLS-only port (8080).

Background
----------
Gateway exposes two listeners:
  :8080 — full mTLS (ssl.CERT_REQUIRED); requires client cert on every connection.
  :8081 — plain HTTP; protected by network isolation (langflow_isolated /
           letta_isolated / openclaw_isolated bridges, Docker internal networks).

Langflow, letta, and openclaw run with cap_drop:[ALL] and mount no client certs
— they cannot complete a TLS handshake with :8080.  They MUST use :8081.

Open WebUI was fixed to use :8081 in v2.23.4.  Langflow and letta were fixed
by e4f38f8.  Openclaw was missed because its gateway URL is in a JSON config
file (openclaw.json), not an env var — Ava cycle 5 discovered it (BUG-V241-
OPENCLAW-EXTENDED, 2026-05-25).

These tests:
  - FAIL against docker-compose.yml pre-Su-fix (8080 values present)
  - PASS after Su's fix (8080 → 8081)
  - Are added to the CI gate (ci.yml unit-test run) so they catch regression
    before any compose change ships

Extended (BUG-V241-OPENCLAW-EXTENDED / YSG-RISK-076): cover JSON config files
(openclaw.json baseUrl) and Helm env vars (OPENCLAW_UPSTREAM_URL) per
[[feedback_brief_cue_adjacent_abstractions]] — assertion scope is now
"every gateway-URL reference in any agent config (env var, JSON, YAML) uses
:8081, never :8080".

A1 amendment principle: absence of a dispatch test = SKIP, not PASS.
Prior E2E sweeps proved container-healthy and route-existence but NOT the
OPENAI_API_BASE callback leg.  This gate closes that assumption gap.
