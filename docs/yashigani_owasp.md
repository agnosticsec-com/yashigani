## Executive Summary

Yashigani is a security enforcement gateway purpose-built for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and agentic AI systems. It operates as a reverse proxy between AI agents and MCP tool servers, providing defense-in-depth through a multi-layer inspection pipeline, OPA-enforced access control, credential isolation, and comprehensive audit infrastructure.

This document maps Yashigani's security controls against three authoritative OWASP frameworks:

- **OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) v5.0** -- 14 control chapters assessed at **Level 3** (highest assurance)
- **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)** -- 10 API-specific risk categories
- **OWASP LLM Top 10 and Agentic AI Security** -- 10 LLM risk categories plus agent-specific controls

ASVS v5 (released 2025) restructured significantly from v4.x. The chapter numbering, requirement identifiers, and several control areas were reorganized. This document follows the v5 structure exclusively.

### Assessment Level

This assessment targets **ASVS v5 Level 3**, the highest assurance tier intended for applications that handle highly sensitive data, perform critical business functions, or operate in high-threat environments. Level 3 requires all Level 1 and Level 2 controls plus additional high-assurance controls including formal verification, hardware-backed security, and advanced cryptographic protections.

### Summary Coverage (ASVS v5 Level 3)

| Verdict | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| PASS | 89 | 59% |
| PARTIAL | 37 | 25% |
| FAIL | 15 | 10% |
| N/A | 9 | 6% |

| Framework | Full Coverage | Partial Coverage | Not Applicable | Not Covered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OWASP ASVS v5 (L3) | 59% | 25% | 6% | 10% |
| OWASP API Security Top 10 | 80% | 20% | 0% | 0% |
| OWASP LLM Top 10 | 70% | 20% | 10% | 0% |

Controls marked PARTIAL reflect areas where Yashigani provides meaningful mitigations but cannot achieve full L3 coverage due to architectural scope boundaries (e.g., client-side controls, hardware attestation, training-time concerns). Controls marked FAIL identify specific L3 requirements not currently implemented.

### Coverage Ratings

- **PASS** -- Yashigani directly implements or enforces this control at L3
- **PARTIAL** -- Control is present but does not fully satisfy L3 requirements
- **FAIL** -- Control is not currently implemented or insufficient for L3
- **N/A** -- Requirement does not apply to a gateway/proxy architecture

---

## Section 1: OWASP ASVS v5 Level 3 Assessment

ASVS v5 defines three verification levels:
- **L1** -- Minimum security baseline (opportunistic)
- **L2** -- Standard for most applications (structured)
- **L3** -- High-assurance for critical and high-value applications (comprehensive)

Level 3 includes all L1 and L2 requirements plus additional controls for defense against advanced attackers, insider threats, and nation-state adversaries.

### V1 -- Architecture, Design, and Threat Modeling

ASVS v5 V1 requires documented security architecture, threat models, and secure design principles applied throughout the SDLC.

| Req ID | Requirement | L3 | Yashigani Control | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V1.1.1 | Verify that a security architecture document exists describing the application's security controls | L1 | This document, plus architecture docs in `/docs/`, threat model in `THREAT_MODEL.md` | PASS |
| V1.1.2 | Verify that a threat model exists and is updated for design changes | L2 | Threat model maintained for the gateway proxy, OPA policy engine, and inspection pipeline; updated per release | PASS |
| V1.1.3 | Verify that all security controls have a centralized implementation | L1 | OPA policy engine is the single authorization decision point; CHS is the single credential stripping point; inspection pipeline is the single content analysis point | PASS |
| V1.1.4 | Verify that security controls are applied on a trusted system | L1 | All controls execute server-side in the gateway process; no security decisions delegated to clients | PASS |
| V1.2.1 | Verify that all authentication pathways and identity management flows are defined in the architecture | L2 | Auth flows documented: local password+TOTP, SAML, OIDC, agent bearer token, JWT validation, WebAuthn/FIDO2 | PASS |
| V1.2.2 | Verify that all access control decisions are documented and centralized | L2 | OPA is the sole authorization engine; RBAC groups and policy bundles are the sole access control definitions | PASS |
| V1.3.1 | Verify that input validation is performed on a trusted system and applied consistently | L1 | FastText+OPA inspection pipeline operates server-side on every request before forwarding | PASS |
| V1.4.1 | Verify that the application uses a vetted cryptographic module | L2 | Python `cryptography` library (OpenSSL backend), `argon2-cffi`, `secrets` module for CSPRNG | PASS |
| V1.4.2 | Verify that all cryptographic operations use a single, approved implementation | L3 | All crypto operations use `cryptography` library or `argon2-cffi`; no hand-rolled crypto; no fallback to weaker implementations | PASS |
| V1.5.1 | Verify that the application segregates sensitive data by sensitivity level | L2 | Credentials in secrets backends (Docker Secrets, Vault, cloud KMS); sensitive DB columns encrypted with AES-256-GCM; audit logs separated from application data | PASS |
| V1.5.2 | Verify that the architecture enforces tenant isolation | L2 | PostgreSQL RLS, separate Redis DB indices per tenant, OPA tenant context in every policy evaluation | PASS |
| V1.6.1 | Verify that the application has a defined secure SDLC process | L3 | GitHub Actions CI with Trivy scanning, CODEOWNERS on security-critical paths, locked dependencies, digest-pinned base images | PARTIAL |
| V1.6.2 | Verify that formal code review is required for security-sensitive changes | L3 | CODEOWNERS enforces review on auth, policy, inspection, and Dockerfile changes; however, no formal security sign-off gate beyond PR review | PARTIAL |
| V1.7.1 | Verify that the architecture documents all third-party components | L2 | `pyproject.toml` with locked/hashed dependencies; Trivy SBOM generation in CI | PASS |
| V1.7.2 | Verify that all third-party components are monitored for vulnerabilities | L2 | Trivy scanning in CI; GitHub Dependabot alerts enabled | PASS |

**Chapter Notes:** Yashigani has strong architectural separation (control plane vs data plane, OPA as single policy engine, CHS as single credential handler). The L3 gaps are in formal SDLC process documentation and formal security sign-off gates, which are process-level requirements rather than technical controls.

| V2.5.2 | Verify that MFA verification occurs at authentication time | L2 | TOTP verified during login flow, not deferred | PASS |
| V2.5.3 | Verify that TOTP shared secrets are stored encrypted | L2 | TOTP secrets stored in AES-256-GCM encrypted PostgreSQL columns | PASS |
| V2.5.4 | Verify that MFA recovery mechanisms are at least as strong as primary MFA | L3 | Recovery codes are 8 single-use codes hashed with Argon2id; recovery invalidates existing session and requires re-enrollment of TOTP | PASS |
| V2.5.5 | Verify that hardware-based authenticators (WebAuthn/FIDO2) are supported | L3 | WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkey support implemented; known constructor bug exists (partially functional) | PARTIAL |

| V2.7.3 | Verify that API credentials are rotatable without downtime | L3 | Agent PSK token rotation with configurable grace periods allows old and new tokens to coexist during rotation window | PASS |
| V2.8.1 | Verify that federation protocols (SAML, OIDC) validate assertions correctly | L2 | SAML: NotBefore/NotOnOrAfter, signature verification against IdP metadata; OIDC: issuer, audience, expiry, JWKS signature verification | PASS |
| V2.8.2 | Verify that JWT algorithms are restricted to an allowlist | L2 | alg:none rejected; HS* rejected; only RS256/384/512 and ES256/384/512 permitted | PASS |
| V2.8.3 | Verify that JWKS key material is rotated and validated | L2 | JWKS waterfall: primary endpoint, secondary fallback, static key file; auto-rotation on upstream 401 | PASS |

**Chapter Notes:** Strong L3 authentication posture. Argon2id with HIBP checking, mandatory TOTP, WebAuthn support (partial due to constructor bug), recovery codes hashed with Argon2id, strict JWT algorithm enforcement, and agent PSK rotation with grace periods. The password strength meter is a minor L1 gap. WebAuthn constructor bug should be fixed for full L3 compliance.

| V8.1.2 | Verify that a data classification policy exists | L3 | Credential patterns and PII hooks are configurable but no formal data classification policy document is bundled | FAIL |
| V8.2.1 | Verify that sensitive data is not cached inappropriately | L2 | Response cache stores CLEAN responses only; BLOCKED/INJECTED/SANITIZED never cached; cache keys exclude credential-bearing headers | PASS |
| V8.2.2 | Verify that sensitive data is not stored in client-side storage | L2 | Backoffice stores no sensitive values in localStorage/sessionStorage; session token in HttpOnly cookie only | PASS |
| V8.2.3 | Verify that sensitive data is cleared from memory when no longer needed | L3 | Python garbage collection handles memory cleanup; no explicit memory zeroing for sensitive variables (Python limitation) | FAIL |
| V8.3.1 | Verify that personal data handling complies with relevant privacy requirements | L2 | PII masking in audit logs; CHS strips credentials; tenant isolation via RLS; however, no built-in GDPR data subject request tooling | PARTIAL |
| V8.3.2 | Verify that data retention policies are enforced | L2 | Audit log rotation with configurable retention; pg_partman time-based partition expiry; Redis TTL on session/cache data | PASS |
| V8.4.1 | Verify that HTTP responses contain appropriate cache control headers | L2 | Backoffice responses include Cache-Control: no-store for sensitive pages; API responses include appropriate cache directives | PASS |
| V8.4.2 | Verify that sensitive data is not included in HTTP GET parameters | L2 | Credentials and session tokens never in URL parameters; all sensitive data in request bodies or cookies | PASS |

| V8.5.2 | Verify that credentials are not exposed to AI/ML processing backends | L2 | CHS strips credentials before all AI inspection calls regardless of backend type | PASS |
| V8.6.1 | Verify that backup data is encrypted | L3 | PostgreSQL backup encryption is delegated to operator infrastructure; Yashigani does not manage database backups directly | FAIL |
| V8.6.2 | Verify that data exports include only authorized data | L3 | Audit log exports respect RLS tenant boundaries; however, no formal data export authorization workflow | PARTIAL |

**Chapter Notes:** Solid data protection controls with CHS credential stripping, multi-tenant isolation, and cache safety. L3 gaps include: no explicit memory zeroing (Python runtime limitation), no formal data classification policy document, no built-in backup encryption (operator responsibility), and no GDPR data subject request tooling.

### V9 -- Communication Security

| Req ID | Requirement | L3 | Yashigani Control | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V9.1.1 | Verify that TLS is used for all connections | L1 | Caddy handles TLS termination; TLS 1.2 minimum; TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled; plain HTTP redirected to HTTPS | PASS |

| V9.1.5 | Verify that certificate validation is performed correctly | L1 | Caddy validates upstream certificates; ACME handles Let's Encrypt certificates automatically | PASS |
| V9.1.6 | Verify that certificate pinning is implemented for high-value connections | L3 | No certificate pinning implemented for connections to external services (inspection backends, SIEM, secrets backends) | FAIL |
| V9.2.1 | Verify that internal service communications are encrypted | L2 | Internal comms (gateway-to-OPA, gateway-to-PostgreSQL, gateway-to-Redis) use network isolation; TLS available but not enforced by default on all internal paths | PARTIAL |
| V9.2.2 | Verify that mutual TLS (mTLS) is used for service-to-service communication | L3 | mTLS not implemented for internal service mesh; relies on Docker network isolation | FAIL |
| V9.3.1 | Verify that certificate management is automated | L2 | Three modes: ACME (automatic Let's Encrypt), CA-signed (operator-provided), self-signed (development); ACME renewal fully automated via Caddy | PASS |
| V9.3.2 | Verify that certificate lifecycle events are logged | L3 | Caddy logs certificate renewal events; however, certificate expiry alerting not integrated into Yashigani audit trail | PARTIAL |
| V9.4.1 | Verify that the application is prepared for post-quantum TLS | L3 | Hybrid X25519+ML-KEM-768 key exchange config included (pending Caddy 2.10 release) | PARTIAL |

**Chapter Notes:** Strong external TLS posture via Caddy with HSTS, strong cipher suites, and automated ACME. L3 gaps are significant: no mTLS for internal service mesh (relies on network isolation), no certificate pinning for external connections, and post-quantum TLS pending upstream Caddy support. Internal mTLS is the highest-priority gap for L3 compliance.

| V10.5.2 | Verify that hardware-level integrity attestation is supported | L3 | No TPM or secure boot attestation; no confidential computing integration (AMD SEV, Intel TDX) | FAIL |

**Chapter Notes:** Strong container security posture with defense-in-depth: seccomp, AppArmor, non-root, read-only filesystem, digest-pinned images, and Trivy scanning. L3 gaps include no independent code audit, no signed commits enforcement, SBOM not formally published, and no hardware-level attestation. The hardware attestation gap is inherent to a software-only product.

---

### V11 -- Business Logic Security

| Req ID | Requirement | L3 | Yashigani Control | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V11.1.1 | Verify that rate limiting is enforced on all sensitive operations | L1 | Four independent rate limit dimensions: per-IP, per-session, per-agent, per-endpoint; all Redis-backed | PASS |
| V11.1.2 | Verify that rate limiting uses a sliding window or token bucket algorithm | L2 | Redis-backed sliding window for rate limiting; Redis ZSET sliding window for anomaly detection | PASS |
| V11.1.3 | Verify that rate limit bypass is not possible through header manipulation | L2 | X-Forwarded-For validated and sanitized; spoofed headers overridden with actual connection IP; trusted proxy chains configurable | PASS |
| V11.2.1 | Verify that business logic is enforced in the correct sequence | L2 | Inspection pipeline stages execute in fixed order: FastText -> OPA -> Ollama -> fallback; no stage skipping | PASS |

| V11.4.2 | Verify that the application implements fraud detection or anomaly alerting | L3 | Anomaly detection alerts to SIEM and optional webhook; audit trail enables forensic analysis; however, no ML-based behavioral anomaly detection beyond the repeated-small-calls heuristic | PARTIAL |
| V11.5.1 | Verify that fail-safe defaults are applied to all business logic decisions | L1 | OPA deny-on-error; inspection pipeline fail-closed on INJECTED; rate limit denial on breach | PASS |

**Chapter Notes:** Comprehensive business logic protection with four-dimensional rate limiting, anomaly detection, and fail-closed defaults throughout. L3 gap is in advanced ML-based behavioral anomaly detection -- the current heuristic (repeated-small-calls) is effective but limited compared to full behavioral analytics.

---

### V12 -- Files and Resources

| Req ID | Requirement | L3 | Yashigani Control | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V12.1.1 | Verify that file upload size limits are enforced | L1 | 4 MB body size limit on all inbound content; enforced at middleware before storage or processing | PASS |
| V12.1.2 | Verify that file type validation is performed | L2 | Content inspected by FastText regardless of declared Content-Type; body content analysis rather than extension-based validation | PASS |
| V12.1.3 | Verify that uploaded files are stored outside the webroot | L1 | Gateway is a proxy -- no file storage to webroot; uploaded content is inspected and forwarded, not persisted | N/A |
| V12.2.1 | Verify that temporary files are stored securely | L2 | tmpfs mounts for transient data; tmpfs does not persist to restart; no sensitive data written to container overlay filesystem | PASS |
| V12.2.2 | Verify that temporary files are deleted promptly | L2 | tmpfs cleared on container restart; no persistent temp file accumulation | PASS |

| V12.5.1 | Verify that resource limits prevent denial of service | L2 | 4 MB body limit; cgroup v2 CPU/memory limits; Redis connection pooling via PgBouncer for PostgreSQL | PASS |

**Chapter Notes:** Most file and resource requirements are satisfied or not applicable given the proxy architecture. The gateway does not store files -- it inspects and forwards. Resource limits are well-defined across body size, container resources, and connection pooling.

---

### V13 -- API and Web Service Security

| Req ID | Requirement | L3 | Yashigani Control | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V13.1.1 | Verify that every API request is authenticated | L1 | OPA policy check on every gateway request; unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints rejected before upstream forwarding | PASS |

| V13.8.1 | Verify that response caching respects authorization | L3 | Response cache stores CLEAN responses only; cache keys exclude credential-bearing headers; cached responses respect tenant isolation | PASS |

**Chapter Notes:** Comprehensive API security with OPA enforcement on every request, strict header handling, and multi-dimensional rate limiting. L3 gaps are minor: API deprecation scheduling and version sunset documentation. The MCP-specific controls (streamable HTTP, SSE) are well-covered.

---

### V14 -- Configuration

| Req ID | Requirement | L3 | Yashigani Control | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V14.1.1 | Verify that the application uses a secure default configuration | L1 | All credentials auto-generated at install (min 36 chars, HIBP-checked); HTTPS enforced; seccomp/AppArmor enabled by default; fail-closed OPA | PASS |

| V14.4.1 | Verify that HTTP-only communication is not permitted | L1 | Plain HTTP redirected to HTTPS by Caddy; no HTTP-only mode in production | PASS |
| V14.4.2 | Verify that CORS policies are restrictive | L2 | Backoffice CORS restricted to same-origin; gateway CORS configurable per deployment with restrictive defaults | PASS |

**Chapter Notes:** Strong secure-by-default configuration with auto-generated credentials, enforced HTTPS, container hardening, and comprehensive security headers. L3 gaps are in deployment-time security validation tooling and infrastructure-as-code policy enforcement. Monitoring coverage is comprehensive for Yashigani components but delegates database and cache monitoring to operators.

## Section 2: OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) Mapping

The OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) identifies the most critical security risks facing modern APIs. This section maps each risk to Yashigani's controls.

---

### API1 -- Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

**Yashigani Controls:** OPA policy evaluation on every request with full context (identity, group, path, method). PostgreSQL RLS enforces per-tenant row isolation at the database layer. RBAC group definitions control permitted object paths. Policy bundle refresh is configurable (default 30 seconds).

**Residual Risk:** OPA policy logic is operator-authored. Overly permissive policies may undermine BOLA protection.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### API2 -- Broken Authentication

**Yashigani Controls:** Argon2id password hashing with HIBP breach checking, mandatory TOTP for admins, WebAuthn/FIDO2 support, strict JWT algorithm enforcement (alg:none and HS* rejected), HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Strict cookies, 128-bit session entropy, agent bearer tokens (min 64 chars), progressive lockout.

**Residual Risk:** Brute-force protection depends on rate limiting configuration. Credential reset delegated to operator IdP.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### API3 -- Broken Object Property Level Authorization

**Yashigani Controls:** OPA policy input includes complete request context. CHS strips credential fields before AI inspection. Backoffice/gateway architectural separation prevents admin property exposure through data plane.

**Residual Risk:** Response filtering for upstream object properties depends on response inspection being enabled.

**Coverage: PARTIAL** (full for gateway objects; partial for upstream response properties)

---

### API4 -- Unrestricted Resource Consumption

**Yashigani Controls:** Four independent rate limiting dimensions (per-IP, per-session, per-agent, per-endpoint), all Redis-backed. Anomaly detection via Redis ZSET sliding window. 4 MB body size limit. Response cache reduces load.

**Residual Risk:** Redis availability is a dependency for rate limiting.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### API5 -- Broken Function Level Authorization

**Yashigani Controls:** OPA policy evaluates method+path+identity on every request. Backoffice architecturally isolated on port 8443 with local auth. Admin routes protected by require_admin_session middleware with TOTP verification.

**Residual Risk:** Network-level port isolation between gateway and backoffice is a deployment requirement.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### API6 -- Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

**Yashigani Controls:** Repeated-small-calls anomaly detection. Per-endpoint rate limits configurable for sensitive operations. Agent token authentication with minimum-length enforcement.

**Residual Risk:** Sensitive business flow semantics depend on upstream MCP server design. Operator policy configuration required for domain-specific flows.

**Coverage: FULL** (with operator policy configuration)

---

### API7 -- Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Yashigani Controls:** Upstream URL is server-configured only (environment variables). No user-controlled URL input determines forwarding destination. OPA path policies restrict forwarded paths. Only outbound connections are to fixed, configured endpoints.

**Residual Risk:** Upstream MCP server SSRF vulnerabilities are out of Yashigani's scope.

**Coverage: FULL** (for SSRF in Yashigani; partial for upstream SSRF)

---

### API8 -- Security Misconfiguration

**Yashigani Controls:** All credentials auto-generated at install (min 36 chars, HIBP-checked). Container hardening by default (seccomp, AppArmor, UID 1001, read-only FS). Caddy HTTPS-only with security headers. Generic error responses. Trivy CI scanning.

**Residual Risk:** Operators who override default hardening reduce security below baseline.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### API9 -- Improper Inventory Management

**Yashigani Controls:** Agent registry with active/inactive lifecycle. Registration events audited. SCIM v2 integration for enterprise IdP-driven lifecycle management. OPA policy bundle defines all active routes; unlisted routes denied by default.

**Residual Risk:** Upstream MCP server endpoints not in policy bundle may be undiscovered.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### API10 -- Unsafe Consumption of External APIs

**Yashigani Controls:** Response inspection pipeline (when enabled) processes upstream responses through FastText+LLM pipeline. Hop-by-hop headers stripped. Response cache stores CLEAN-only. Inspection backend API keys in secrets backends; CHS strips credentials before sending payloads.

**Residual Risk:** Response inspection is configuration-dependent. Disabled deployments lose upstream validation.

**Coverage: FULL** (with response inspection enabled; partial without)

---

## Section 3: OWASP Agentic AI and LLM Top 10 Mapping

---

### LLM01 -- Prompt Injection

**Yashigani Controls:** Multi-stage, multi-backend detection: FastText ML first-pass (<5ms) -> Ollama LLM second-pass (local) -> multi-backend fallback (Anthropic, Gemini, Azure OpenAI). INJECTED payloads discarded, never forwarded. Configurable confidence thresholds with escalation on low confidence. Fail-closed on pipeline failure.

**Residual Risk:** Novel injection patterns may evade FastText. LLMs can be manipulated in adversarial scenarios. Defense in depth with OPA limits blast radius.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### LLM02 -- Insecure Output Handling

**Yashigani Controls:** Response inspection (when enabled) validates upstream outputs through same pipeline. Backoffice strict CSP blocks inline scripts. Audit log records classification and payload hash for forensics.

**Residual Risk:** Response inspection is operator-configurable.

**Coverage: PARTIAL** (depends on response inspection configuration)

---

### LLM03 -- Training Data Poisoning

**Yashigani Controls:** FastText training scripts provided for operator audit. Model binary digest-pinned in container image. Multi-backend fallback provides cross-check against compromised single model.

**Residual Risk:** Training-time concern outside runtime proxy scope.

**Coverage: PARTIAL** (integrity controls on artifacts; training process out of scope)

---

### LLM04 -- Model Denial of Service

**Yashigani Controls:** Rate limiting prevents excessive inspection pipeline load. Anomaly detection identifies resource exhaustion patterns. Ollama queue limits with fallback routing. Container cgroup v2 resource limits.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### LLM05 -- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

**Yashigani Controls:** Trivy CI scanning, digest-pinned base images, hashed/locked dependencies, CODEOWNERS on security-critical files.

**Residual Risk:** Third-party inference backend security is out of scope (mitigated by CHS credential stripping).

**Coverage: FULL** (for Yashigani supply chain)

---

### LLM06 -- Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Yashigani Controls:** CHS strips credential patterns before all AI backend calls. PII masking hooks in audit logs. AES-256-GCM column encryption. Keys in secrets backends.

**Residual Risk:** Novel credential formats may evade CHS pattern matching.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### LLM07 -- Insecure Plugin and Tool Design (MCP Context)

**Yashigani Controls:** OPA policy evaluation on every MCP tool call with full context. Tool path authorization via policy bundle. Agent registration with token authentication.

**Residual Risk:** Upstream MCP server implementation security is out of scope.

**Coverage: FULL** (at the proxy boundary)

---

### LLM08 -- Excessive Agency

**Yashigani Controls:** Agent bearer token minimum length (64 chars). RBAC group assignments via OPA. Full agent action audit trail. Anomaly detection for autonomous behavior patterns. Per-agent rate limits.

**Residual Risk:** Policy granularity depends on operator RBAC configuration.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### LLM09 -- Overreliance

**Yashigani Controls:** Multi-backend fallback with fail-closed sentinel. UNCERTAIN escalation to next stage rather than default allow. Configurable confidence thresholds. Audit records include decision, confidence, and backend.

**Residual Risk:** Human review of audit logs is not automated.

**Coverage: FULL**

---

### LLM10 -- Model Theft

**Yashigani Controls:** Ollama runs locally; model weights not network-accessible. Inspection backend API keys in secrets backends. CHS prevents credential leakage to backends. ECDSA P-256 offline licence verification (ML-DSA-65 planned).

**Residual Risk:** Customer-owned model protection on upstream MCP servers is out of scope.

**Coverage: PARTIAL** (protects Yashigani's inspection models; customer models out of scope)

---

### Agentic AI Specific Controls

| Control | Implementation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Agent identity verification | Bearer token, min-length 64, registry lookup | Ensures only registered agents access MCP tools |
| Per-agent rate limiting | Redis sliding window, independent of per-IP/session | Constrains autonomous agent action rates |
| Agent anomaly detection | Redis ZSET sliding window, repeated-small-calls | Identifies unexpected agent call patterns |

| Agent lifecycle management | Active/inactive status, admin UI | Rapid deactivation of compromised agents |
| SCIM v2 provisioning | RFC 7644-compliant provisioning | Enterprise IdP-driven agent lifecycle |
| Multi-tenant isolation | RLS + separate Redis DBs + OPA tenant context | Cross-tenant protection |
| Fail-closed policy engine | OPA deny-on-error | Policy failures cannot grant access |
| Response chain tracing | W3C traceparent, X-Trace-Id, tail sampling, Jaeger | End-to-end trace visibility |

## Section 5: Gap Analysis and Residual Risk

This section documents areas where Yashigani's controls do not fully satisfy ASVS v5 Level 3 requirements. Security architects performing due diligence should review these gaps when assessing residual risk.

---

### Gap 1: Internal Mutual TLS (V9.2.2) -- FAIL

**Nature of gap:** ASVS v5 L3 requires mutual TLS for service-to-service communication. Internal communications (gateway to OPA, PostgreSQL, Redis) rely on Docker network isolation rather than mTLS.

**What Yashigani does:** Deploys services within isolated container networks. TLS is available for PostgreSQL and OPA connections. Network policies restrict cross-service reachability.

**What Yashigani does not do:** Enforce mTLS on all internal service connections by default. Provide built-in certificate management for an internal service mesh.

**Recommended mitigations:** Configure TLS for PostgreSQL and Redis connections. Deploy a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for automatic mTLS. For highest assurance, use sidecar proxies with certificate rotation.

**Priority: HIGH** (most significant L3 gap)

---

### Gap 2: Certificate Pinning (V9.1.6) -- FAIL

**Nature of gap:** L3 requires certificate pinning for high-value external connections. Yashigani does not pin certificates for connections to inspection backends, SIEM endpoints, or secrets backends.

**What Yashigani does:** Validates standard certificate chains. Uses ACME for automated certificate management.

**Recommended mitigations:** Implement certificate pinning for inspection backend connections (Anthropic, Gemini, Azure OpenAI). Pin SIEM endpoint certificates. Consider DANE/TLSA as an alternative to HTTP-based pinning.

**Priority: MEDIUM**

---

### Gap 3: Hardware Attestation (V10.5.2) -- FAIL

**Nature of gap:** L3 requires hardware-level integrity attestation (TPM, secure boot). Yashigani is a software-only product and does not integrate with hardware security modules for attestation.

**What Yashigani does:** Software-level integrity: seccomp, AppArmor, read-only filesystem, digest-pinned images.

**Recommended mitigations:** Deploy on confidential computing platforms (AMD SEV, Intel TDX). Use TPM-backed measured boot for the host OS. Consider UEFI Secure Boot for the container host.

**Priority: MEDIUM** (dependent on deployment environment)

---

### Gap 4: Memory Zeroing (V8.2.3) -- FAIL

**Nature of gap:** L3 requires sensitive data to be cleared from memory when no longer needed. Python's garbage collector does not guarantee deterministic memory zeroing of string objects.

**What Yashigani does:** Uses short-lived variables for sensitive data. Session invalidation removes server-side session state.

**What Yashigani does not do:** Explicitly zero password strings, TOTP secrets, or encryption keys in memory after use. This is a fundamental limitation of the Python runtime.

**Recommended mitigations:** For highest assurance, security-critical cryptographic operations could be delegated to a C extension that performs explicit memory zeroing. Alternatively, deploy in confidential computing environments where memory is encrypted.

**Priority: LOW-MEDIUM** (Python runtime limitation; mitigated by container isolation)

---

### Gap 5: Key Destruction Verification (V6.5.3) -- FAIL

**Nature of gap:** L3 requires verification that retired cryptographic keys are securely destroyed. Yashigani delegates key lifecycle to secrets backends but does not verify destruction.

**Recommended mitigations:** Implement key destruction verification callbacks for each secrets backend. Use cloud KMS key scheduling for destruction with confirmation.

**Priority: LOW**

---

### Gap 6: Data Classification Policy (V8.1.2) -- FAIL

**Nature of gap:** L3 requires a formal data classification policy. CHS provides technical credential classification, but no formal policy document defines data sensitivity levels.

**Recommended mitigations:** Create a data classification policy document mapping sensitivity levels to handling requirements. Map CHS patterns and PII hooks to classification levels.

**Priority: LOW** (process gap, not technical)

---

### Gap 7: Backup Encryption (V8.6.1) -- FAIL

**Nature of gap:** L3 requires backup data to be encrypted. Yashigani does not manage database backups; this is delegated to operator infrastructure.

**Recommended mitigations:** Configure PostgreSQL backup encryption (pg_basebackup with encryption, or encrypted storage volumes). Ensure Redis persistence files are on encrypted storage.

**Priority: LOW** (operator infrastructure responsibility)

---

### Gap 8: WebAuthn Constructor Bug (V2.5.5) -- PARTIAL

**Nature of gap:** WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkey support exists but has a known constructor bug that prevents full functionality.

**Recommended mitigations:** Fix the constructor bug to achieve full WebAuthn L3 compliance. This is planned for a future release.

**Priority: MEDIUM** (hardware authenticators are important for L3)

---

### Gap 9: Formal Code Audit (V10.1.1) -- PARTIAL

**Nature of gap:** L3 expects formal independent code audits. Yashigani is open source with CODEOWNERS-enforced review but has not undergone a formal third-party security audit.

**Recommended mitigations:** Commission an independent security audit from a qualified firm. Publish audit results.

**Priority: HIGH** (important for L3 credibility)

---

### Gap 10: Post-Quantum Cryptography (V6.2.3, V9.4.1) -- PARTIAL

**Nature of gap:** Hybrid X25519+ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65 are prepared but blocked on upstream library/tooling support (Caddy 2.10, `cryptography` FIPS 204).

**Recommended mitigations:** Track upstream release schedules. Enable PQ hybrid modes as soon as dependencies ship. Test PQ key exchange in staging environments.

**Priority: LOW** (proactive preparation is strong; blocked on ecosystem)

---

### Gap 11: Training Data Poisoning (LLM03)

**Nature of gap:** Training-time concern outside runtime proxy scope.

**Recommended mitigations:** Secure model training pipeline. Monitor classification accuracy over time.

**Priority: N/A** (architectural scope boundary)

---

### Gap 12: Response Inspection Dependency (LLM02, API10)

**Nature of gap:** Several controls depend on YASHIGANI_INSPECT_RESPONSES being enabled, which is not the default in all configurations.

**Recommended mitigations:** Enable response inspection for high-sensitivity deployments. Consider selective per-path response inspection to balance security and performance.

**Priority: MEDIUM**
