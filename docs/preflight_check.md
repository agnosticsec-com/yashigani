# Yashigani Pre-Installation Checklist

**Version:** v0.9.4
**Last updated:** 2026-03-31
**Purpose:** Everything you must gather, configure, or verify *before* running `install.sh` or `docker compose up`. The automated installer handles software installation and secret generation — but it cannot know your infrastructure topology, DNS records, upstream server addresses, or credentials for external services. Collect all items marked **Required** before you start.

---

## How to Use This Document

Work through each section that applies to your deployment. Items marked:

- **Required** — installer will fail or Yashigani will not start without this
- **Required for mode** — only required if you choose that TLS/KMS/SSO/SIEM option
- **Recommended** — safe defaults exist but you should set this for production
- **Optional** — only needed if you enable that feature

At the end of each section there is a short checklist you can print and tick off.

---

## Section 1 — Core Infrastructure (All Installations)

These items are required regardless of deployment mode.

### 1.1 Server

| Item | Required? | Where Used | Example |
|------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Server IPv4 address | Required | DNS A record, firewall rules | `203.0.113.42` |
| Server hostname/FQDN | Required | `YASHIGANI_TLS_DOMAIN` | `mcp-gateway.example.com` |
| Operating system and version | Required | Installer picks correct Docker install method | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64 |
| CPU architecture | Required | Installer selects correct image variants | `amd64` or `arm64` |
| Available RAM (GB) | Required | Preflight check — minimum 2 GB, 4 GB for Ollama | 8 GB |
| Available disk on Docker data root (GB) | Required | Preflight check — minimum 10 GB. On macOS, `preflight.sh` uses `df -k` (POSIX-compatible) instead of `df -BG` (GNU-only). | 50 GB |
| Shell | Informational | Preflight reports the user's login shell (`$SHELL`) — typically zsh on modern macOS. The installer is compatible with bash 3.2+ (macOS default) and zsh 5+. | zsh 5.9, bash 5.2 |

### 1.2 Upstream MCP Server

Yashigani proxies ALL traffic to one primary upstream. You must know where it is.

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Upstream MCP server URL (base URL) | **Required** | `UPSTREAM_MCP_URL`. Must be reachable from the Docker internal network. If on the same host, use the host's internal IP, not `localhost` (Docker networking). |
| Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) | Required | If HTTPS, ensure the container can validate or skip TLS for internal servers. |
| Authentication the upstream expects | Recommended | Yashigani strips agent credentials from payloads *it* inspects, but must still forward auth to the upstream. Confirm upstream auth scheme (bearer token, mTLS, API key header). |
| MCP tool paths/endpoints | Recommended | Used when writing OPA policy rules (`/tools/read`, `/tools/write`, etc.). List all paths agents will call. |
| Expected request body size | Recommended | Default limit is 4 MB. If your MCP tools receive larger payloads, increase `YASHIGANI_BODY_LIMIT_MB`. |

> **Note:** If you have multiple upstream MCP servers, Yashigani v0.6.0 routes to one primary upstream. Use path-based OPA policy to allow/deny specific sub-paths per agent.

### 1.3 Network and Firewall

| Port | Direction | Required? | Service |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 80/tcp | Inbound | Required (ACME mode) or redirect | Caddy HTTP → HTTPS redirect + ACME HTTP-01 challenge |
| 443/tcp | Inbound | **Required** | Caddy HTTPS (all user and agent traffic) |
| 22/tcp | Inbound | Recommended | SSH admin access |
| 5432/tcp | Internal only | Must NOT be exposed externally | PostgreSQL |
| 6379/tcp | Internal only | Must NOT be exposed externally | Redis |
| 8181/tcp | Internal only | Must NOT be exposed externally | OPA |
| 11434/tcp | Internal only | Must NOT be exposed externally | Ollama |
| 8080/tcp | Internal only | Must NOT be exposed externally | Gateway |
| 8443/tcp | Internal only | Must NOT be exposed externally | Backoffice |
| 18789/tcp | Inbound | Optional — OpenClaw bundle only | OpenClaw Gateway (messaging webhooks) |

> **Warning:** The Docker Compose `internal: true` flag on the `internal` network prevents direct external access to most services. Still verify your host firewall (iptables/ufw/nftables) blocks these ports at the host level if you have other containers or processes that bypass the Docker network.

### Checklist — Section 1

```
[ ] Server IPv4 address noted
[ ] FQDN chosen and noted (this becomes YASHIGANI_TLS_DOMAIN)
[ ] Upstream MCP server URL confirmed reachable
[ ] Upstream MCP tool paths documented for OPA policy
[ ] Ports 80 and 443 open inbound (or 443 only if you redirect 80 externally)
[ ] Internal ports (5432, 6379, 8181, etc.) blocked at host firewall
[ ] Server has ≥ 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended), ≥ 10 GB free disk
```

---

## Section 2 — DNS (Required for ACME and CA TLS Modes)

### 2.1 DNS Records

| Record | Type | Value | Required for |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| `your-domain.com` | A | Server IPv4 | ACME, CA |
| `your-domain.com` | AAAA | Server IPv6 (optional) | ACME (if IPv6) |

> **Note:** DNS must be fully propagated before you run the installer in ACME mode. Let's Encrypt's HTTP-01 challenge will fail if the domain does not resolve to your server's IP. Use `dig +short your-domain.com` from the server itself to confirm.

### 2.2 DNS TTL

For production: set DNS TTL to 300 seconds (5 minutes) before cutover, and restore to 3600 after. This makes rollback faster if something goes wrong.

### Checklist — Section 2

```
[ ] DNS A record created pointing FQDN → server IP
[ ] DNS propagation verified (dig +short your-domain.com = your server IP)
[ ] TTL set to 300 for initial deployment
[ ] Wildcard certificate not required (Yashigani uses a single domain)
```

---

## Section 3 — TLS Mode Selection

Choose **one** TLS mode before installation. This cannot be changed without restarting Caddy.

### 3.1 ACME / Let's Encrypt (Production Default)

**Pre-requirements:**
- DNS record pointing to the server (Section 2)
- Ports 80 and 443 open from the public internet
- Admin email address for Let's Encrypt expiry notifications

| Item | Required? | Value |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Admin email for ACME | Required | `YASHIGANI_ADMIN_EMAIL` or `CADDY_ACME_EMAIL` |
| Confirm port 80 open from internet | Required | Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 uses this |
| Confirm port 443 open from internet | Required | Traffic and TLS termination |

> **Note:** Caddy handles certificate issuance and renewal automatically. No manual cert management needed.

### 3.2 CA-Signed Certificate (Enterprise/Internal)

**Pre-requirements:**
- Certificate file (PEM format, full chain): `server.crt`
- Private key file (PEM format, unencrypted): `server.key`
- Both files for the exact FQDN in `YASHIGANI_TLS_DOMAIN`

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `server.crt` (full chain PEM) | **Required** | Place in `docker/tls/server.crt` |
| `server.key` (unencrypted PEM) | **Required** | Place in `docker/tls/server.key`. chmod 600. |
| Certificate CN or SAN matches domain | **Required** | Caddy will reject mismatched certificates |
| Certificate not expired | **Required** | Check: `openssl x509 -in server.crt -noout -dates` |
| CA bundle included in chain | Recommended | Clients that don't trust the CA root need the full chain |

```bash
# Verify before placement:
openssl x509 -in server.crt -noout -subject -issuer -dates
openssl verify -CAfile ca-bundle.crt server.crt
# Confirm key matches cert:
diff <(openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in server.crt) \
     <(openssl pkey -pubout -in server.key)
```

### 3.3 Self-Signed (Demo / Local Only)

No pre-requirements. Caddy generates an internal CA automatically.
Set `YASHIGANI_TLS_DOMAIN=localhost` and `YASHIGANI_TLS_MODE=selfsigned`.

> **Warning:** Self-signed mode is NOT suitable for production. Browsers and agents will reject the certificate unless they trust Caddy's internal CA.

### Checklist — Section 3

```
[ ] TLS mode selected: [ ] acme  [ ] ca  [ ] selfsigned
[ ] ACME: admin email noted, ports 80+443 open
[ ] CA: server.crt and server.key obtained and verified
[ ] CA: cert CN/SAN matches YASHIGANI_TLS_DOMAIN exactly
[ ] Selfsigned: understand demo-only limitation
```

## Section 4 — Cloud / VM Environment

The installer auto-detects these but you should confirm them in advance for non-interactive installs.

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Cloud provider | Recommended | AWS / GCP / Azure / DigitalOcean / Hetzner / none |
| VM hypervisor | Info only | KVM / VMware / VirtualBox / HyperV / bare metal |
| Container runtime preference | Recommended | Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, or Podman — all supported as first-class runtimes (v0.8.4). On macOS the installer checks for Docker Desktop at `/Applications/Docker.app` first. If Docker Desktop is installed but the `docker` CLI is not in PATH, the preflight offers to create the symlink automatically with a single Y/n prompt. |
| If AWS: region | Required for AWS KMS | e.g. `us-east-1` |
| If AWS: IAM role or access keys | Required for AWS KMS | EC2 instance role preferred over static keys |
| If GCP: project ID | Required for GCP KMS | e.g. `my-project-123456` |
| If Azure: subscription / resource group | Required for Azure KMS | For Key Vault access |

---

## Section 4a — GPU Detection (v0.8.4)

The installer runs GPU detection automatically via `platform-detect.sh`. No action is required for the detection itself. Use this section to verify your GPU is supported and to choose an appropriate Ollama model before installation.

### 4a.1 Supported GPU Platforms

| Platform | Detection Method | Compute Framework | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Apple Silicon (M-series) | `sysctl hw.memsize` + chip model | Unified memory, Metal, ANE | No VRAM separation — system RAM is shared. Installer recommends model based on total RAM. |
| NVIDIA | `nvidia-smi` | CUDA | Requires `nvidia-container-toolkit` for Docker GPU passthrough. |
| AMD | `rocm-smi` | ROCm | Requires ROCm-compatible driver and container runtime. |
| Unknown discrete GPU | `lspci` (fallback) | None | Detected but not accelerated. Installer warns and recommends CPU inference. |
| No dedicated GPU | Software fallback | CPU only | Installer recommends small models (3B parameters or less) for CPU inference. |

### 4a.2 Model Recommendations by VRAM

The installer prints a recommended Ollama model based on detected GPU VRAM or unified memory:

| Available VRAM / Unified Memory | Recommended Model |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| < 4 GB | `qwen2.5:0.5b` (CPU only or very low-end GPU) |
| 4–6 GB | `qwen2.5:3b` (default) |
| 8–12 GB | `llama3.2:8b` or `mistral:7b` |
| 16 GB+ | `llama3.1:14b` or `qwen2.5:14b` |

> **Note:** These are starting recommendations. Actual performance depends on memory bandwidth and concurrent workload. Monitor Ollama container memory usage during the first week and adjust `OLLAMA_MODEL` in `.env` as needed.

### 4a.3 NVIDIA GPU — Pre-requirements

If the installer detects an NVIDIA GPU and you want to use it for Ollama:

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| NVIDIA driver 525+ | Required | `nvidia-smi` must succeed |
| `nvidia-container-toolkit` | Required | Install: `sudo apt-get install nvidia-container-toolkit` |
| CUDA-compatible GPU | Required | Pascal (GTX 1000 series) or newer |

After installing `nvidia-container-toolkit`, uncomment the `deploy.resources` GPU block in `docker-compose.yml` under the `ollama` service.

### 4a.4 Apple Silicon — Pre-requirements

Docker Desktop 4.x on macOS automatically enables Apple Silicon acceleration for Ollama. No additional packages are required. Set memory allocation to at least 10 GB in Docker Desktop preferences when running 7B+ models.

### Checklist — Section 4a

```
[ ] GPU detection result noted (Apple Silicon / NVIDIA / AMD / CPU-only)
[ ] NVIDIA: nvidia-container-toolkit installed (if using NVIDIA GPU)
[ ] Apple Silicon: Docker Desktop memory allocation ≥ 10 GB for 7B+ models
[ ] Ollama model selected based on available VRAM / unified memory
```

## Section 9b — AES Key Provisioning (v0.9.0)

v0.9.0 requires an AES-256-GCM key for PostgreSQL column encryption. The installer manages this automatically, but review the options before starting.

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| AES key provisioning mode | **Required** | Auto-generate (default) or BYOK |
| BYOK key file | Required if BYOK | 32-byte random key in binary format. Pass with `--aes-key /path/to/key.bin`. The installer stores it in the configured KMS. |
| Key backup | Required | If auto-generated, the installer stores the key in KMS. Ensure your KMS is backed up before starting. If using Docker secrets, back up `docker/secrets/aes_key` to a secure location. |
| Key rotation plan | Recommended | AES key rotation requires a DB re-encryption job. Plan the rotation cycle before production deployment. |

> **Warning:** Loss of the AES key renders all encrypted PostgreSQL columns (audit events, inference payloads, WebAuthn credentials) unreadable. Ensure the key is stored in a backed-up KMS or secure key store before starting.

### Checklist — Section 9b

```
[ ] AES key provisioning mode decided: [ ] auto-generate  [ ] BYOK
[ ] BYOK: 32-byte key file prepared and path noted
[ ] KMS backup confirmed (key will be stored there)
[ ] Key recovery plan documented
```

## Section 10 — Agent and MCP Registration

You register agents (AI clients) in the admin panel after installation. Prepare:

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| List of agents to register | Required | Each agent needs: name, description, path prefix |
| Path prefix per agent | Required | Which MCP paths each agent is allowed to call (e.g. `/tools/read`, `/tools`) |
| Token management plan | Required | Tokens are shown only once. Have a secure storage plan (vault, 1Password, etc.) |
| Tier limits | Note | Community: 5 agents / 10 end users / 2 admin seats. Starter: 100/250/25. Professional: 500/1,000/50. Pro Plus: 2,000/10,000/200. Enterprise: unlimited. |

For each agent, note:
- **Name**: human-readable (e.g. `claude-code-agent`)
- **Description**: what it does (e.g. `VSCode Claude Code extension`)
- **Path prefix**: the MCP sub-path it should access (e.g. `/tools`)
- **Rate limit override**: if different from global default
- **IP allowlist** (v0.7.0): if the agent will only ever connect from known CIDRs (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8`), prepare the CIDR list now — it can be set at registration time or updated later

The registration response includes a `quick_start` field with copy-paste curl, Python httpx, and health-check snippets using the live bearer token. Save these along with the token.

### Checklist — Section 10

```
[ ] Agent inventory created (name, description, path prefix for each)
[ ] Token storage method decided (secret manager, vault, encrypted file)
[ ] (v0.7.0) IP CIDR allowlists defined for agents with known source IPs
[ ] Community: agents ≤ 5, end users ≤ 10, admin seats ≤ 2
[ ] Starter: agents ≤ 100, end users ≤ 250, admin seats ≤ 25
[ ] Professional: agents ≤ 500, end users ≤ 1,000, admin seats ≤ 50
[ ] Professional Plus: agents ≤ 2,000, end users ≤ 10,000, admin seats ≤ 200
[ ] Enterprise: unlimited — no pre-check needed
```

## Section 13 — Observability Pre-Requirements

### 13.1 Prometheus / Grafana

No external pre-requirements. Both are included in the stack.

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Basic auth for `/metrics-federate` | Auto-generated. Note the hash from `docker compose logs backoffice`. |
| Grafana admin password | Auto-generated at first run. |
| External Prometheus federation | Optional. If you have a central Prometheus, configure scrape job for `https://your-domain/metrics-federate`. |

### 13.2 Jaeger Tracing

No pre-requirements. Jaeger is included in the stack (in-memory storage).

> **Note:** Default Jaeger uses in-memory storage — traces are lost on restart. For production, configure a persistent Jaeger backend (Cassandra, Elasticsearch). Set `SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=elasticsearch` and configure Jaeger's ES connection.

### 13.3 Loki Log Aggregation

No external pre-requirements. Loki + Promtail are included.

> **Note:** Promtail mounts `/var/lib/docker/containers` and `/var/run/docker.sock` to ship container logs. Ensure the Docker socket is accessible and the Promtail container has read permission.

---

## Section 14 — PostgreSQL

The Postgres instance is embedded in the stack. No external database is needed by default.

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Backup strategy for `postgres_data` volume | **Recommended for production** | Use `docker run --volumes-from postgres pgbackup` or a volume snapshot |
| External Postgres (optional) | Optional | Override `YASHIGANI_DB_DSN` in `.env` to use an external PG instance (RDS, AlloyDB, etc.) |
| If external Postgres: version | Required | PostgreSQL ≥ 14. pgcrypto extension must be enabled. |
| If external Postgres: SSL mode | Required | Use `sslmode=require` or `verify-full` |
| If external Postgres: user privileges | Required | Superuser for initial migration, then `yashigani_app` role for runtime |

```sql
-- Pre-create if using external Postgres:
CREATE DATABASE yashigani;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
CREATE ROLE yashigani_app WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'generated_at_runtime';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE yashigani TO yashigani_app;
```

---

## Section 15 — Security and Hardening

These are not installer inputs but must be planned before go-live.

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| OPA policy review | **Required** | The default policy is permissive. Review and customize `policy/` for your use case. |
| Admin account inventory | Required | Minimum 2 admin accounts required. Plan who will hold them. |
| TOTP enrollment plan | Required | All admin accounts must enroll TOTP before the bootstrap admin password is distributed. |
| Admin initial password handling | Required | Printed at first run, one-time display. Store in password manager immediately. |
| Host-level audit logging | Recommended | `/var/log/auth.log` + SSH logging in addition to Yashigani's own audit |
| Container image pinning | Recommended | Replace `:latest` tags in docker-compose.yml with specific digest-pinned versions for production. |
| Seccomp/AppArmor | Recommended | Verify profiles are loading: `docker inspect --format='{{.HostConfig.SecurityOpt}}' yashigani-gateway-1` |
| Volume encryption | Recommended | For cloud deployments, use encrypted EBS/Persistent Disk/Azure Managed Disk for the Docker data root |
| Backup encryption | Recommended | Encrypt all Postgres backups at rest |

### Checklist — Section 15

```
[ ] OPA policy (`policy/` directory) reviewed and customized
[ ] At least 2 admin accounts planned with named owners
[ ] TOTP enrollment scheduled for all admin accounts at first login
[ ] Postgres backup strategy decided and scheduled
[ ] Container image pinning done for production docker-compose.yml
[ ] OPA deny-by-default confirmed for unlisted paths
```

## Section 16 — Interactive Fallback Prompts (v0.8.4)

In v0.8.4, when automatic detection fails for OS, container runtime, or GPU, the installer falls back to interactive selection menus rather than aborting. This section documents what to expect and what to have ready.

### 16.1 When Fallback Prompts Appear

| Detection Scenario | Fallback Behavior |
|--------------------|------------------|
| OS could not be determined | Installer presents a numbered list: `1) linux  2) macos  3) other` |
| Container runtime not found | Installer presents: `1) docker  2) docker-desktop  3) podman` |
| GPU detection failed or no GPU found | Installer presents: `1) nvidia  2) apple-silicon  3) amd  4) none (CPU only)` |

### 16.2 Non-Interactive Mode

For automated or CI deployments, bypass interactive prompts using flags:

```bash
./install.sh \
  --os linux \
  --runtime docker \
  --gpu nvidia \
  --non-interactive
```

If `--non-interactive` is set and required detection fails, the installer aborts with a clear error rather than hanging for input.

### Checklist — Section 16

```
[ ] Understood: interactive prompts may appear if detection fails
[ ] Non-interactive deployments: --os, --runtime, --gpu flags prepared
[ ] CI/CD pipelines: --non-interactive flag added to install command
```

---

## Section 17 — Updating an Existing Installation (v0.8.4)

`update.sh` handles updating an existing Yashigani installation. It is the recommended path for patch and minor version updates.

### 17.1 What update.sh Does

1. **Backs up** the current `.env`, `docker/secrets/`, and `config/` directories to a timestamped archive.
2. **Pulls** the latest Docker images for all stack services.
3. **Restarts** the stack with `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans`.
4. **Runs** Alembic migrations automatically via the backoffice start sequence.
5. **Rolls back** automatically if the backoffice fails to reach `healthy` status within the configured timeout — restores the pre-update backup and brings the previous image versions back up.

### 17.2 Running the Update

```bash
./update.sh
```

For a specific version:

```bash
./update.sh --version v0.8.4
```

To skip the interactive confirmation:

```bash
./update.sh --non-interactive
```

### 17.3 Pre-Update Checklist

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Postgres volume snapshot | **Recommended** | Take a snapshot before any update. See Section 14. |
| `.env` backup | Auto-handled by `update.sh` | Also back up manually to an off-host location |
| Confirm no pending Alembic state | Recommended | `docker compose exec backoffice alembic current` should show a clean head |
| Disk space for new images | Required | Ensure ≥ 5 GB free on Docker data root |

### Checklist — Section 17

```
[ ] Postgres volume backed up (or snapshot taken)
[ ] Disk space confirmed ≥ 5 GB free
[ ] `update.sh` reviewed (in repo root)
[ ] Rollback plan understood (update.sh handles automatically; manual restore from backup is the fallback)
```
