# Yashigani Release Process

**Last updated:** 2026-05-08T16:00:00+01:00

This document covers the end-to-end process for cutting a Yashigani release from a clean branch tip to a signed, published GitHub release with full evidence archive. It is the authoritative source for M7 gate-check procedures.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

| Tool | Why needed | Install |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `git` | Commit, tag, push | OS package |
| `gh` CLI | Download CI artifacts, create release | `brew install gh` (macOS) / see [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) |
| `gh auth login` | PAT with `repo` + `read:packages` scopes | `gh auth login --scopes repo,read:packages` |

Note: workflow edits (anything under `.github/workflows/`) require a PAT with `workflow` scope in addition to `repo`. Split workflow commits from code commits when needed.

---

## 2. CI Workflow Summary

Three workflows provide the M7 gate evidence:

### 2.1 CI (`ci.yml`)

Triggers on push/PR to: `main`, `release/**`, `v2.23.*`, `2.23.x`.

| Job | What it does | Artifacts uploaded |
|-----|--------------|--------------------|
| `test` (matrix: py3.12, py3.13) | `pytest src/tests/` with `--junitxml` | `unit-tests-py3.12-<sha>`, `unit-tests-py3.13-<sha>` |
| `mypy` (py3.12) | `mypy src/yashigani/` with `--xml-report` | `mypy-<sha>` |

Artifact retention: **90 days**.

### 2.2 Security Scan (`security.yml`)

Triggers on push/PR to same branches; scheduled runs add extended rule-packs.

| Job | Trigger | Artifacts uploaded |
|-----|---------|--------------------|
| `opengrep-push` | push/PR | `opengrep-<sha>` |
| `opengrep-full` | schedule (03:00 UTC) | SARIF only (Code Scanning) |
| `bandit-sast` | push/PR/schedule | `bandit-report` |
| `pip-audit` | push/PR/schedule | `pip-audit-report` |

Artifact retention: **90 days**.

## 3. Artifact Contents

### Unit-test artifact (`unit-tests-py<ver>-<sha>/`)

```
test-results-<ver>.xml    # JUnit XML, parseable by CI dashboards
verdict-<ver>.txt         # Grep-able verdict lines:
                          #   Unit tests: PASS|FAIL
                          #   Total: <n>
                          #   Passed: <n>
                          #   Failed: <n>
                          #   Skipped: <n>
                          #   Commit: <sha>
                          #   Workflow: CI
                          #   Run: <run-id>
```

### Mypy artifact (`mypy-<sha>/`)

```
mypy-xml/index.xml        # XML report from --xml-report
mypy-xml/any-exprs.txt    # Any-expression report
mypy-output.txt           # Full stdout/stderr from mypy run
mypy-summary.txt          # Grep-able verdict lines:
                          #   Type check: PASS|FAIL
                          #   Errors: <n>
                          #   Files checked: <n>
                          #   Commit: <sha>
                          #   Workflow: CI
                          #   Run: <run-id>
```

### Opengrep artifact (`opengrep-<sha>/`)

```
opengrep-results.json     # Full JSON output from opengrep scan
opengrep-summary.txt      # Grep-able verdict lines:
                          #   Opengrep: PASS|FAIL
                          #   Critical: <n>
                          #   High: <n>
                          #   Medium: <n>
                          #   Low: <n>
                          #   Info: <n>
                          #   Total findings: <n>
                          #   Scan errors: <n>
                          #   Commit: <sha>
                          #   Workflow: Security Scan
                          #   Run: <run-id>
```

**PASS/FAIL semantics:** `Opengrep: PASS` requires zero CRITICAL or HIGH findings AND zero scan errors. MEDIUM/LOW findings produce `PASS` with non-zero counts (non-blocking). A scan infrastructure error always produces `FAIL`.

---

## 4. Evidence Archive

CI evidence lives OUTSIDE the yashigani repo (in the DevOps evidence repository).

**Archive root:** an DevOps evidence directory, organised by version + commit SHA.

**Archive script:** `scripts/archive_ci_artifacts.sh`

```sh
# Usage (run from inside the yashigani repo directory):
scripts/archive_ci_artifacts.sh <commit-sha> <version>

# Example for v2.23.1 at ec46ab4:
scripts/archive_ci_artifacts.sh ec46ab4 2.23.1
```

The script:
1. Uses `gh run list --commit <sha>` to find all workflow runs for the commit.
2. Warns if any runs are not yet completed.
3. Downloads all artifacts from completed runs via `gh run download`.
4. Copies the three gate artifacts to the canonical evidence path.
5. Writes `archive-manifest.txt` listing all captured files.
6. Runs the gate verdict check inline and exits non-zero on any FAIL.

---

## 5. Pre-flight Gate Check (M7)

Run this one-liner before cutting any release tag. Every line must exit 0.

```sh
# Artifact dir names embed the full SHA. Use glob to match regardless of
# whether SHA is short or full. Resolve with git rev-parse first.
SHA=$(git rev-parse ec46ab4)
VER=2.23.1
BASE="${YASHIGANI_EVIDENCE_ROOT:?set to the DevOps evidence directory}/v${VER}/ci-evidence/${SHA}"

grep -q "Unit tests: PASS" "${BASE}"/unit-tests-py3.12-*/verdict-3.12.txt \
  && grep -q "Unit tests: PASS" "${BASE}"/unit-tests-py3.13-*/verdict-3.13.txt \
  && grep -q "Type check: PASS" "${BASE}"/mypy-*/mypy-summary.txt \
  && grep -q "Opengrep: PASS"   "${BASE}"/opengrep-*/opengrep-summary.txt \
  && echo "ALL CI GATES PASS — safe to tag" \
  || echo "FAIL — one or more gates not green"
```

Release-gate boxes tick ONLY when this grep passes on real downloaded artifacts. A CI URL alone is not sufficient evidence.

---

## 6. Full Release Checklist (M7)

Execute in order. Gate N does not start until Gate N-1 is GREEN.

| # | Gate | Owner | Evidence path | Verdict grep |

---

## 6a. Specialist PR Review Gate

**Rationale:** F-T10-001 (2026-05-06) — the container specialist authored Python `gateway/` code that shipped two correctness bugs (`math.isfinite` NaN clamp, `float(os.getenv(...))` DoS on bad env value). The Python specialist caught both on review. Root cause: wrong specialist dispatched for the language domain. Rule codified in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-max-Documents-Claude/memory/feedback_right_specialist_per_language.md`.

**Domain-to-specialist mapping (MUST have approval before merge):**

| Files changed | Required reviewer | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| `src/yashigani/gateway/**/*.py` | Python specialist | `tom@agnosticsec.com` |
| Any other `**/*.py` (services, tests, migrations) | Python specialist | `tom@agnosticsec.com` |
| `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, `restore.sh`, `update.sh`, `scripts/*.sh`, `*.sh` entrypoints | Installer specialist | `su@agnosticsec.com` |
| `Dockerfile*`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `helm/**`, `**/*.yaml` K8s manifests | Container specialist | `captain@agnosticsec.com` |

**Hard rule:** A PR touching files in one of the above domains MUST carry an approved review from the listed specialist before it is counted as merged for the purposes of this gate. An approval from any other reviewer does not substitute.

**How to verify at release time:**

For each PR merged into the release branch since the previous release tag, run:

```sh
# List PRs merged in release range:
gh pr list --state merged --base 2.23.x --limit 100 --json number,title,mergedAt,reviews

# For each PR touching gateway/ Python:
gh pr view <number> --json reviews | jq '.reviews[] | select(.state=="APPROVED") | .author.login'
# Must include the Python specialist account (tom@agnosticsec.com).

# For each PR touching install.sh / scripts/:
# Must include the installer specialist account (su@agnosticsec.com).

# For each PR touching Dockerfiles / helm/:
# Must include the container specialist account (captain@agnosticsec.com).
```

**Evidence format:** paste the `gh pr view` output per PR (or the `gh pr list` JSON) into the release evidence directory as `ci-evidence/<sha>/specialist-review-gate.txt`. Gate 6a is GREEN only when every in-scope PR has the required approval recorded in that file.

**Cross-domain PRs:** decompose at review time — a PR touching Python and Helm needs both the Python specialist and container specialist approvals. A PR touching Python and shell needs both the Python specialist and installer specialist approvals.

## 6b. Dependency-Bump Sweep Gate (G16) — HARD STOP

**Origin:** `feedback_image_pinning.md` (container images); `feedback_dependabot_triage_cadence.md` (all dep types, 2026-05-08 Astro 4→6 catch-up incident).

**Supersedes:** the image-only G16 draft in PR #84. This is the canonical, extended G16 covering all dependency types across all repos.

**When to run:** at the start of every release cycle, immediately after the release branch is cut, before any feature work or pre-tag activity. If not run at branch-cut time, run and clear before Gate 13 (HITL GO).

**Failure mode:** HARD STOP — no merge to main, no release tag, until G16 is PASS.

**Owner mapping — generative by dep type (applies to ALL Agnostic Security repos, current AND future):**

The owner-by-dep-type mapping is the canonical rule. New repos inherit this mapping by default — no per-repo configuration required. Tiago directive: "for any future projects or products/services" (2026-05-08).

| Dep type | Default owner |
|---|---|
| Python packages (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, lock files) | Tom |
| Container / OCI images (Dockerfile, docker-compose, Helm `image:`) | Captain |
| Helm chart dependencies (`Chart.yaml`) | Captain |
| Kubernetes manifest version pins | Captain |
| GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/*.yml` `uses:`) | Captain |
| JS / npm / TypeScript / frontend frameworks | Tom (interim — frontend specialist gap per `project_team_gaps_cto_coo.md`) |
| Shell / installer / systemd-unit dependencies | Su |
| Rust packages (`Cargo.toml`) | Tom (interim — Rust specialist gap) |
| Go modules (`go.mod`) | Tom (interim — Go specialist gap) |

Maxine reviews and signs off in the release evidence directory before Gate 13.

#### Current-state repo coverage (snapshot, not authoritative — rule is the table above)

| Repo | Dep types present |
|---|---|
| `agnosticsec-com/yashigani` | Python, Container/Helm, K8s, GitHub Actions, Shell |
| `agnosticsec-com/acs` | Python, GitHub Actions |
| `agnosticsec-com/agnosticsec-website` | JS/npm, GitHub Actions |
| (Future) Any new product / service repo | All applicable types — automatically covered by generative owner mapping |

### PASS/FAIL semantics

**PASS:** all deps within 2 minor versions of latest stable, OR pinned with documented rationale, AND zero open HIGH/CRITICAL Dependabot alerts in any Agnostic Security repo (current or future).

**FAIL:** any dep >2 minor behind without rationale, OR any open HIGH/CRITICAL Dependabot alert in any Agnostic Security repo (current or future), OR any floating-stub tag in container image pins (see below).

### Command sequence — container images (Captain)

```sh
# 1. Enumerate every image reference across compose, Helm, and Dockerfiles
grep -E '^\s+image:|^FROM ' \
  docker/docker-compose.yml \
  docker/docker-compose.*.yml \
  docker/Dockerfile.* \
  2>/dev/null | sort -u

grep -E 'tag:|repository:' \
  helm/yashigani/values.yaml \
  helm/yashigani/values.release.yaml \
  2>/dev/null | sort -u

# 2. For each GitHub-hosted image, query upstream latest stable:
gh api "/repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest" --jq '.tag_name'

# 3. For Docker Hub images, query current tags:
curl -s "https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/<owner>/<repo>/tags/?page_size=20&ordering=last_updated" \
  | jq -r '.results[].name' | head -10

# 4. Resolve digest for each image being pinned in the release overlay:
docker buildx imagetools inspect <registry>/<name>:<tag> \
  --format '{{json .Manifest}}' | jq -r '.digest'
# or: crane digest <registry>/<name>:<tag>

# 5. Verify no floating-stub tags remain in dev compose (no-floating-stubs rule, 2026-05-07):
grep -rE 'image: .+:(latest|[0-9]+-[a-z]+|[a-z]+-[0-9]+)\s*$' \
  docker/docker-compose.yml docker/docker-compose.*.yml \
  helm/yashigani/values.yaml
# Any output = FAIL (floating-stub pin found)

# 6. Verify release overlay: every image ref must contain '@sha256:'
grep -E '^\s+image:' docker/docker-compose.release.yml \
  | grep -v '@sha256:' && echo "FAIL: unpinned image(s) in release overlay" \
  || echo "Release overlay: all images digest-pinned"

grep -E 'digest:' helm/yashigani/values.release.yaml | wc -l
# Count must equal number of external images in scope
```

### Command sequence — Python packages (Tom)

```sh
# 1. Check pyproject.toml / requirements files for version pins
grep -rE '^[A-Za-z].*[>=<~^]' pyproject.toml requirements*.txt 2>/dev/null

# 2. Run pip-audit against the lock file (already a CI gate — run locally to preview)
pip-audit --requirement requirements.txt --format json | jq '.dependencies[] | select(.vulns | length > 0)'

# 3. Compare pinned versions against PyPI latest stable for key deps:
pip index versions <package>   # shows available versions

# 4. Confirm zero open HIGH/CRITICAL pip-audit findings:
# CI pip-audit artifact must show exit 0 (see Gate 6 in §6 table).
```

### Command sequence — npm/JS packages (Tom, interim for agnosticsec-website)

```sh
# Run from the agnosticsec-website repo root:

# 1. List outdated packages:
npm outdated

# 2. Check for known vulnerabilities:
npm audit --audit-level=high
# Exit non-zero = FAIL for HIGH+CRITICAL. MEDIUM treated per triage SOP.

# 3. Verify lock file is committed and up to date:
git diff package-lock.json  # must be clean (no unstaged lock drift)

# 4. Check for packages >2 minor behind:
# npm outdated output — "Wanted" vs "Latest" columns. Any gap >2 minor = document rationale.
```

### Command sequence — GitHub Actions (Captain)

```sh
# For each Agnostic Security repo with GitHub Actions present (see current-state snapshot above):

# 1. List all workflow files and their pinned Action SHAs:
grep -rn 'uses:' .github/workflows/ | grep -v '#'

# 2. For each action, verify the pinned SHA corresponds to a current tagged release:
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name'
# or check https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases

# 3. If a SHA is pinned to a tag >2 minor behind latest: document rationale or bump.
```

### Command sequence — Helm chart dependencies (Captain)

```sh
# From yashigani repo:
cat helm/yashigani/Chart.yaml | grep -A 5 'dependencies:'

# For each dependency entry, check the upstream chart repo for latest stable version:
helm search repo <repo>/<chart> --versions | head -10
# or check the chart's GitHub releases.

# Update if stale:
helm dependency update helm/yashigani/
```

### Evidence file format

The sweep owner writes `ci-evidence/<sha>/dep-bump-sweep.txt`:

```
Dep sweep: PASS
Date: <ISO-8601>
Release: v<ver>
Commit: <sha>
Checked by: captain@agnosticsec.com (images/Actions/Helm), tom@agnosticsec.com (Python/JS)
Signed off by: maxine@agnosticsec.com

Container images checked (<n> total):
  postgres:<tag>@sha256:<digest>   upstream-latest: <tag>   status: CURRENT
  redis:<tag>@sha256:<digest>      upstream-latest: <tag>   status: CURRENT
  ...

Python packages — yashigani:
  cryptography <ver>   latest: <ver>   status: CURRENT
  ...

npm/JS packages — agnosticsec-website:
  astro <ver>          latest: <ver>   status: CURRENT
  ...

GitHub Actions — yashigani:
  docker/login-action@<sha> (v<tag>)   latest: v<tag>   status: CURRENT
  ...

Helm chart dependencies — yashigani:
  <chart> <ver>   latest: <ver>   status: CURRENT
  ...

Hold-backs (if any):
  <dep>  held at <ver>  reason: <CVE/regression/rationale>  planned-bump: <date>

Open HIGH/CRITICAL Dependabot alerts:
  yashigani: 0
  acs: 0
  agnosticsec-website: 0

Floating-stub check (container images): PASS (zero matches)
Release-overlay digest-pin check: PASS (all <n> images carry @sha256:)
```

Any dep >2 minor behind without a documented hold-back, or any open HIGH/CRITICAL Dependabot alert, produces `Dep sweep: FAIL`.

Hold-backs are permitted only when the latest stable has an active CVE or confirmed regression. Each hold-back must carry a planned-bump date and must be logged in the release retro.

---

## 6c. Inter-Release Dependabot Triage SOP

The dep-bump sweep (§6b / G16) runs at release time. Between releases, Dependabot alerts must be triaged on a rolling cadence to prevent accumulation. The 2026-05-08 Astro 4→6 incident (9 CVEs on agnosticsec-website while Astro stayed pinned at ^4.16.0) is the origin of this SOP.

**Canonical memory reference:** `feedback_dependabot_triage_cadence.md`

### Cadence

| Severity | Triage window | Fix window |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH / CRITICAL | ≤ 24 h from alert | ≤ 5 working days |
| MEDIUM | ≤ 7 days | bundle fix in next release cycle |
| LOW | monthly review | absorb in regular bump sweep |

### Owner mapping — generative by dep type

The owner-by-dep-type mapping is the canonical rule and applies to ALL current AND future Agnostic Security repos by default. Tiago directive: "for any future projects or products/services" (2026-05-08).

| Dep type | Default owner |
|---|---|
| Python packages (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, lock files) | Tom |
| Container / OCI images (Dockerfile, docker-compose, Helm `image:`) | Captain |
| Helm chart dependencies (`Chart.yaml`) | Captain |
| Kubernetes manifest version pins | Captain |
| GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/*.yml` `uses:`) | Captain |
| JS / npm / TypeScript / frontend frameworks | Tom (interim — frontend specialist gap per `project_team_gaps_cto_coo.md`) |
| Shell / installer / systemd-unit dependencies | Su |
| Rust packages (`Cargo.toml`) | Tom (interim — Rust specialist gap) |
| Go modules (`go.mod`) | Tom (interim — Go specialist gap) |

#### Current-state repo snapshot (not authoritative — rule is the table above)

| Repo | Dep types present |
|---|---|
| `agnosticsec-com/yashigani` | Python, Container/Helm, K8s, GitHub Actions, Shell |
| `agnosticsec-com/acs` | Python, GitHub Actions |
| `agnosticsec-com/agnosticsec-website` | JS/npm, GitHub Actions |
| (Future) Any new product / service repo | All applicable types — automatically covered by generative owner mapping |

#### When a new repo is created

1. Enable Dependabot in `.github/dependabot.yml` for every dep type present in that repo.
2. Confirm the generative owner mapping above covers all alert surfaces — no per-repo owner override required.
3. If a new dep type appears that is not in the table above, propose an extension to both this doc and `feedback_dependabot_triage_cadence.md`, and flag to Maxine.
4. Add the repo to the weekly Maxine triage roster — no further onboarding steps required.

### Workflow

1. Dependabot opens alert (auto-notifies owner per repo settings).
2. Owner triages within cadence window: confirm impact + plan fix (`immediate` / `next-release` / `accept-risk`).
3. If **immediate**: branch + PR + CI green + merge within 5 working days (HIGH/CRITICAL).
4. If **next-release**: tag the alert with `defer:vN.Y.Z` label in GitHub.
5. If **accept-risk**: document rationale in the exception register and close with `wontfix` or equivalent — requires Maxine sign-off.
6. Maxine reviews Dependabot alert status weekly (surfaced in release planning check-in).
7. G16 at next release will FAIL if any HIGH/CRITICAL alert remains open without an `accept-risk` exception on record.

---

## 7. Tagging

### 7.1 Signing method

All release tags from v2.23.1 onward are **GPG-signed** (annotated tag objects with a PGP signature). The signing key identity is `releases@agnosticsec.com`.

Signing is handled automatically by CI (`.github/workflows/tag-sign.yml`):

1. Push the annotated tag to `origin`.
2. The `tag-sign.yml` workflow imports the `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` secret, deletes the unsigned tag, re-creates it as a signed tag at the same commit, verifies the signature, and force-pushes it back.
3. Downstream: `build-push.yml` and `release.yml` trigger on the tag and build/sign/publish images (cosign keyless) + SBOM.

Tag consumers should always fetch with `--force` to pick up the re-signed object:

```sh
git fetch --tags --force origin
git tag -v v2.23.2    # expects: "Good signature from releases@agnosticsec.com"
```

### 7.2 Pushing a tag (Release Engineer — Gate 14)

```sh
# On branch 2.23.x, tip at the release SHA:
git tag -a "v2.23.2" -m "Yashigani v2.23.2

<paste release headline bullets here>"
git push origin "v2.23.2"
# CI tag-sign.yml signs it automatically; wait for the workflow to complete
# then verify:
git fetch --tags --force origin
git tag -v v2.23.2
```

The `build-push.yml` and `release.yml` workflows trigger automatically on `v*.*.*` tags and handle image build, cosign signing, SBOM generation, and GitHub release creation.

### 7.3 Local signing (offline / emergency)

If CI is unavailable, use the local signing script (requires GPG key on dev machine):

```sh
bash scripts/sign_release_tag.sh v2.23.2 <commit-sha>
```

See `scripts/sign_release_tag.sh` for prerequisites and key setup instructions.

### 7.4 Retroactive signing of existing unsigned tags

If a tag was pushed without a signature, dispatch the `tag-sign.yml` workflow manually:

```
GitHub -> Actions -> "Tag -- GPG Sign & Verify" -> Run workflow
  tag: v2.23.1
  commit_sha: 733c3624ed04bc51e1982fca690b33232861884a
```

The workflow re-creates the tag as signed at the same commit and force-pushes it. This is a corrective action and must be noted in the release retro (finding V232-NEG02).

---

## 8. Post-release

1. Fast-forward `main` to the release tag: `git push origin 2.23.x:main`.
2. Update `README.md` and `docs/` for the new version.
3. Archive the release evidence directory to long-term storage.
4. Write the release retro (ISO 9001 §9.3/10.2/10.3) in the DevOps evidence repository.
5. Open the next version milestone on GitHub.

---

## 11. Release History

| Version | Date | Tag SHA (short) | Branch tip SHA | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| v2.23.2 | 2026-05-03 | `7dcd498` | `7dcd498` | Security hardening, supply-chain, ASVS L3 92%. GPG-signed (see §9 ceremony). |
| v2.23.1 | 2026-05-02 | `3b49d0e` | `3b49d0e` | Core-plane mTLS, two-tier PKI, release hardening. GPG signing available via §7.4 retroactive dispatch. |

> **GPG signing status:** Tag signing infrastructure (key ceremony + CI workflow `tag-sign.yml`) landed in the v2.23.2 release cycle. Both v2.23.2 and v2.23.1 can be verified via `git tag -v <tag>` after completing the key ceremony in §9.

## 9. GPG Release Signing Key Setup (one-time, per team)

This section documents the one-time key-generation ceremony. It must be performed by a designated release manager with access to add GitHub repository secrets.

### 9.1 Generate the key

```sh
gpg --full-generate-key
# Choose: (1) RSA and RSA  -- or (4) RSA (sign only) for a dedicated signing key
# Key size: 4096
# Expiry: 2y  (renew before expiry; update docs/release-signing-key.asc on renewal)
# Real name: Agnostic Security Releases
# Email: releases@agnosticsec.com
# Comment: (leave blank)
```

### 9.2 Export private key (for GitHub Secrets)

```sh
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys releases@agnosticsec.com
# Copy the full armored block including -----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
# Store as GitHub Secret: GPG_PRIVATE_KEY
# Store the passphrase as: GPG_PASSPHRASE
```

### 9.3 Export public key (for in-repo trust anchor)

```sh
gpg --armor --export releases@agnosticsec.com > docs/release-signing-key.asc
git add docs/release-signing-key.asc
git commit -m "chore(pki): add GPG release signing public key (releases@agnosticsec.com)"
```

### 9.4 Configure GitHub Secrets

In the yashigani repository settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions:

| Secret name | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` | Armored private key block from §9.2 |
| `GPG_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase chosen during key generation |

### 9.5 Verify CI signing works

Push a test tag on a non-main branch (e.g. `v0.0.0-test`) and confirm the `tag-sign.yml` workflow completes with "Signature: GOOD". Delete the test tag afterward.

### 9.6 Status — v2.23.2 release (GPG signing)

The v2.23.2 tag (`7dcd498`) has been pushed. The GPG key ceremony (§9.1–§9.4) must be completed to activate tag-signing CI. Until the ceremony is complete, the tag is unsigned.

**Maintainer action required:** complete §9.1 through §9.4 to generate the `releases@agnosticsec.com` key and add `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` / `GPG_PASSPHRASE` to GitHub Secrets. Then dispatch `tag-sign.yml` twice:

1. Retroactive v2.23.1 sign:
   - `tag: v2.23.1`, `commit_sha: 3b49d0e` (or the full SHA from `git rev-parse v2.23.1`)
2. v2.23.2 sign:
   - `tag: v2.23.2`, `commit_sha: 7dcd498b906a5dab8ba7e1456db6c7001f2a98a6`

After both dispatches succeed, verify with `git fetch --tags --force origin && git tag -v v2.23.2`.

---

## 10. Tag signature verification (for end users and auditors)

All Yashigani releases from v2.23.1 onward are signed with the Agnostic Security GPG release key. To verify:

```sh
# 1. Import the Agnostic Security release signing public key (once):
gpg --import docs/release-signing-key.asc

# 2. Fetch tags (force-refresh in case a tag was re-signed):
git fetch --tags --force origin

# 3. Verify the tag signature:
git tag -v v2.23.2
# Expected output includes:
# "Good signature from 'Agnostic Security Releases <releases@agnosticsec.com>'"
```

Container image signatures (gateway and backoffice) are verified separately via cosign. See `scripts/sign_image.sh` for commands.
